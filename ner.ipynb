Learn more ORDER This matter is before the court on defendants' motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or in the alternative, for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.  Based on a review of the 7le, record, and for the following reasons, the court grants defendants' motions and plainti9's claims are dismissed. 1 1 Defendant Brad Wayne was dismissed from this matter at the hearing unopposed by plainti9. (See also Pl.'s Mem. at 30.) BACKGROUND On June 27, 1995, three-year old Jessica Swanson was reported missing to law enforcement authorities from her home in Goodhue County, Minnesota. In the four years that followed the disappearance of Jessica Swanson, Minnesota law enforcement agencies conducted an extensive investigation into her disappearance and were unable to resolve the circumstances surrounding her disappearance. During the period of 1995 through 1999, law enforcement agencies identi7ed the main suspect as Dale Jenson, the live-in boyfriend of Jessica Swanson's mother and the last person to see her. During the summer of 1999, the Goodhue County Attorney's o:ce and Goodhue County law enforcement agencies concluded that probable cause existed to charge Dale Jenson with the kidnaping of Jessica Swanson as well 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 3/18 as with the deprivation of parental and custodial rights. The mother of Jessica Swanson, Michelle Swanson, was to be charged with assisting Jenson. At about the same time that the decision was made to charge Dale Jenson, the Goodhue County Sheri9, Dean Albers, informed county attorney Steven Betcher that the sheri9 would seek the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") in an attempt to interview Dale Jenson. Dale Jenson had been interviewed in excess of 20 times between 1995 and 1999 by law enforcement o:cers from various agencies within the State of Minnesota. Sheri9 Albers indicated to the county attorney that FBI special agent Daniel Craft was highly experienced in interviewing subjects in similar cases. The Goodhue County Attorney's o:ce had no prior knowledge of, nor did they have any experience in working with Mr. Craft. On August 24, 1999, a meeting was held in the Goodhue County Law Enforcement Center to review with Agent Craft what had happened on the case to that point and the relevant Minnesota law pertaining to criminal suspect interviews.  During the meeting, Agent Craft asked what to do if Jenson requested an attorney. Craft was informed that in previous interviews Jenson had requested an attorney but then revoked the request. It was determined that should Jenson again request an attorney, Craft should ignore the request since it was likely that Jenson would revoke the request. 2 2 Present at this meeting were Goodhue County Sheri9 Dean Albers, Randy Mickelson, Patrick Thompson, Bob Dissell and Scott McNurlin, all of the Goodhue County Sheri9's Department, David Price of the Rochester o:ce of the FBI, Herm Dybezick of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and FBI Agent Daniel Craft. Goodhue County Attorney Steven Betcher and Assistant County Attorney Carol Lee also came to the meeting after it had commenced but where not present for all portions of the meeting. On August 25, 1999, Dale Jenson was asked to come to the Dakota County Law Enforcement Center in Hastings, Minnesota to meet with the law enforcement o:cers. Jenson was living in Hastings at that time and he complied with the request. FBI Agent Craft then conducted an interview with Dale Jenson that lasted approximately three hours and ten minutes. The interview was both videotaped and audiotaped. At the beginning of the 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 4/18 interview, Jenson was only told part of the Miranda warning. He was not informed that if he could not a9ord an attorney one would be appointed for him before any questioning and that at any time during the questioning he could exercise the protections provided by the Miranda warning. He was also not asked if he speci7cally waived his Miranda rights. During the interview, Dale Jenson talked about the need for an attorney and at one point said, \"I want an attorney.\" The interview continued without Jenson talking to a lawyer. Jenson subsequently confessed that he had accidentally killed Jessica and hid her body. That same day, he led law enforcement o:cers to where he had hidden her body. On August 26, 1999, Dale Jenson was arraigned on a felony complaint. Mary D. Wing7eld, Assistant District Public Defender, was appointed to represent Jenson. The state provided Jenson and his counsel complete copies of the interview tapes along with other discovery materials. On September 17, 1999, at a pretrial hearing before the Honorable Richard C. Perkins, Ms. Wing7eld, counsel for Jenson, informed the court that Jenson wished to waive the omnibus hearing and intended to plead guilty to manslaughter in the second degree. At the plea and sentencing hearing on September 24, 1999, before the Honorable Richard C. Perkins, the Goodhue County Attorney Steven Betcher and First Assistant County Attorney Carol Lee appeared on behalf of the state and Mary Wing7eld and Anthony Ho, another assistant district public defender, appeared on behalf of Jenson. Scott Swanson from the state public defender's o:ce also appeared. Jenson entered a plea of guilty to one count of manslaughter in the second degree with the charges of kidnaping and deprivation of parental rights being dismissed as a condition of the entry of guilt on the manslaughter charge. When directly questioned by the court, the defendant admitted that he understood the charge and entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter in the second degree. Upon further questioning by the court and by Ms. Wing7eld, the factual basis for the manslaughter guilty plea was placed on the record. Jenson further stated that his attorney had adequately represented his interests and that he had no further questions regarding the proceeding. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 5/18 Subsequent questioning placed a knowing waiver of defendant's right to an omnibus hearing on the record, at which time the issue of probable cause and the confession could be raised. The record clearly re8ects that both the defendant and his attorney knew of the constitutional issues that could have been raised at an evidentiary hearing and that a hearing might have determined that the FBI agent had violated Jenson's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in light of the way that the interview was conducted. Jenson expressly waived his right to contest these constitutional issues. Jenson did not appeal his guilty plea to the Minnesota Court of Appeals or the Minnesota Supreme Court. Jenson has now 7led suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unnamed Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging that all of the named defendants, in their individual and o:cial capacities, violated: (1) plainti9's constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution ; (2) plainti9's rights under Article I, Section 6, 7 and 8 of the Minnesota Constitution; and (3) plainti9's rights pursuant to State v. Scales, 518 N.W.2d 587 (Minn. 1994) and Minn. Stat. § 481.10 (1998). 3 3 Plainti9 brings these claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. While plainti9 asserts in his complaint a cause of action for conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985, he later acknowledges in his memorandum that this was an error and any conspiracy claim should be considered under § 1983. (See Pl.'s Mem. at 28-29 (\"The court should take heed of these paragraphs [pleading conspiracy], and view the conspiracies pleaded at Claims IV and V as conspiracies under sec. 1983, not sec. 1985(3) as mistakenly pleaded.\").) DISCUSSION I. Standard of Review Defendants bring a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) (6), the court must accept as true, in a hypothetical sense, all of the factual allegations in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Riley v. St. Louis County, Mo., 153 F.3d 627, 630 (8th Cir. 1998). A motion to dismiss for failing to state a claim should be granted if it is beyond doubt that no relief can be granted under any set of facts when the allegations are construed in a light most favorable to the pleader. County of St. Charles v. Missouri Family 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 6/18 Health Council, 107 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir. 1997). Rule 12(b)(6) requires a court to treat a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 when the parties present matters outside the pleadings that the court does not exclude. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); see also Gibb v. Scott, 958 F.2d 814, 816 (8th Cir. 1992). The parties have submitted a substantial number of documents outside the pleadings for consideration in this matter. While the court determines that defendants are entitled to a Rule 12 dismissal since plainti9 fails to state a viable claim on the pleadings as is discussed in part II of this order, the court also 7nds, alternatively, that when the court considered matters outside of the pleadings in parts III and IV of this order, defendants are also entitled to summary judgment.4 4 In particular, the court reviewed the transcripts of the August 25, 1999, interview and the September 24, 1999 plea and sentencing hearing in state court. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating to the court that no genuine issue of material fact exists. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). A fact is material only when its resolution a9ects the outcome of the case. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that it could cause a reasonable jury to return a verdict for either party. See id. at 250. On a motion for summary judgment, all evidence and inferences are to be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See id. at 255. The nonmoving party, however, may not rest upon mere denials or allegations in the pleadings, but must set forth speci7c facts su:cient to raise a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Moreover, if a plainti9 cannot support each essential element of its claim, summary judgment must be granted because a complete failure of proof regarding an essential element necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. See id. at 322-23. With these standards at hand, the court considers the defendants' motions. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 7/18 II. Plainti9 Presents No Viable Constitutional Law Claims A. No Cause Of Action Under Miranda The essence of plainti9's assertion of a violation of his constitutional rights is his allegation that defendants conspired to violate his Miranda rights during the interrogation on August 25, 1999. Plainti9 speci7cally asserts that defendant Daniel Craft repeatedly ignored his requests for an attorney and continued to question him after he indicated to Craft that he wanted an attorney.5 5 The Miranda rule only applies to statements made during custodial interrogations. Here, defendants assert that plainti9 was not in custody for purposes of Miranda since he voluntarily came to the police station, was interviewed in an unlocked room, was free to leave at any point during his interview, and at one point, even left the interview room unaccompanied to use the restroom. Although the court tends to agree with defendants' assertion since it is not entirely convinced that the facts demonstrate that plainti9 was in custody for purposes of Miranda at the time that he confessed, the court concludes that it need not directly resolve this issue given its 7nding that plainti9's case fails on the other legal bases discussed. Plainti9's § 1983 claim on the basis of this alleged constitutional violation, however, is foreclosed by the controlling law in this circuit. In Warren v. City of Lincoln, 864 F.2d 1436, 1442 (8th Cir. 1989), the Eighth Circuit held that no cause of action arises under § 1983 for a failure to a9ord a detainee his rights under Miranda. Instead, the only remedy for a Miranda violation is the exclusion from evidence of any compelled testimony arising therefrom. See id. Since defendant has no cause of action under the controlling law of this circuit, defendants' motions to dismiss must be granted.6 6 The court also concludes that plainti9 cannot sidestep well-settled Eighth Circuit precedent by restyling this matter as a \"non-Miranda violation case\" under the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (See Pl.'s Mem at 35, n. 8.) Plainti9's reliance on Ninth Circuit caselaw is misplaced in light of this Circuit's clear ruling in Warren that a plainti9 cannot maintain an action for questioning \"outside\" Miranda. See Warren, 864 F.2d at 1442. Moreover, the undisputed circumstances of this case are factually inapposite to the substantive due process cases that plainti9 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 8/18 Plainti9 has also brought a claim under the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel \"requires the existence of both `criminal prosecution' and an `accused.'\" United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180, 188 (1984). attempts to rely on. See, e.g., Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936) (confession extracted by beating defendants); Gray v. Spillman, 925 F.2d 90 (4th Cir. 1990) (defendant beaten by police); Wilkins v. May, 872 F.2d 190 (7th Cir. 1989) (confession extracted after police handcu9ed defendant and held gun to his head); Ware v. Reed, 709 F.2d 345 (5th Cir. 1983) (beating during interrogation); Duncan v. Nelson, 466 F.2d 939 (7th Cir. 1972) (suspect kept in solitary con7nement for 18 day before being handcu9ed to chair for 4 hours before confessing). B. No Cause Of Action Under the Sixth Amendment The right \"does not attach until after the initiation of formal charges.\" Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 431 (1986). Thus, a Sixth Amendment right only attaches \"at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings — whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\" Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689 (1972). The mere fact that plainti9 was the focus of a criminal investigation does not cause the right to attach. See United States v. Ingle, 157 F.3d 1147, 1151 (8th Cir. 1998); Warren, 864 F.2d at 1442. Moreover, \"the 7ling of a criminal complaint and the issuance of an arrest warrant do not constitute the initiation of an adverse judicial proceeding for purposes of [the Sixth Amendment right to counsel]\". Von Kahl v. United States, 242 F.3d 783, 789 (8th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Here, plainti9 has not pleaded facts, nor can he plead facts, that fall within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It is undisputed that Jenson voluntarily came to the sheri9's o:ce and that no formal criminal proceeding had been implemented at the time of the interview. The court thus concludes that plainti9's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not triggered. Accordingly, the court concludes that plainti9's Sixth Amendment claim fails and must be dismissed.7 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 9/18 Defendants also argue that plainti9 has no cause of action under Bivens v. Six Unnamed Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Bivens allows federal causes of action for injuries arising from the unconstitutional conduct of law enforcement agents. Bivens, 403 U.S. at 397. Here, plainti9's Bivens claim is predicated upon the alleged violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. 7 The court notes that plainti9 appears to concede that his Sixth Amendment claim fails as a matter of law since he acknowledges in his memorandum that he \"does not rest [his opposition to defendants's motions] upon the Sixth Amendment.\" (See Pl.'s Mem. at 28.) Instead, \"Mr. Jenson rests his opposition . . . on the substantive due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\" (Id.) C. No Cause Of Action Under Bivens However, since the court 7nds that no violation occurred under either amendment, plainti9's Bivens claim fails. Furthermore, a Bivens cause of action for an alleged constitutional violation will not lie in one of two instances: (1) when the defendant demonstrates \"special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of a:rmative action by Congress;\" and (2) when the defendant shows that \"Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally e9ective.\" Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18-19 (1980). Defendants assert that since there already exists a remedy to protect those persons allegedly denied their Fifth Amendment Miranda rights, namely, the exclusionary-rule that dictates that any evidence obtained in violation of Miranda will be excluded at trial, there exists no separate Bivens cause of action for the same alleged violation. The court agrees, especially when considering the unambiguous precedent of this Circuit. See Warren, 864 F.2d at 1422 (holding that no constitutional tort action lies for a Miranda violation, rather, exclusionary rule constitutes aggrieved party's remedy). Accordingly, the court concludes that any claim plainti9 asserts under Bivens must be dismissed as a matter of law. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 10/18 III. Plainti9's Previous Guilty Plea Precludes Him From Re-litigating the Constitutionality of His Interrogation Notwithstanding the foregoing grounds for dismissal under Rule 12, there is an additional basis for granting defendants summary judgment since plainti9 pleaded guilty to second degree manslaughter in Minnesota state court. Plainti9 did not appeal or challenge that plea. In fact, plainti9 expressly acknowledged and waived the same constitutional claims that he now tries to assert in the present action. During his plea and sentencing hearing on September 24, 1999, plainti9, under oath, engaged in the following allocation with his counsel: Plainti9's Counsel: There are some things that have come up as well, and that is with regard to the taking of your statement, and that's a constitutional issue that would have been heard at a later evidentiary hearing. The issue would have been whether the o:cer violated your Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights in doing so, I am speaking of the special agent involved from the F.B.I; do you understand that? Jenson: Yes. Plainti9's Counsel: If you were to be successful in that regard, that doesn't mean that your case would be dismissed but, it does mean the evidence they obtained, if the Judge would so rule, would not be used against you, not in the State's case-in-chief, anyway; you understand that? Jenson: Yes. Plainti9's Counsel: Again, by pleading guilty here this afternoon, you will not be able to visit that issue either later or should you subsequently change your mind that you want to have a hearing on that, you are giving up that right? Jensen: Yes. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 11/18 (See Transcript of Plea and Sentencing Hearing, Betcher A9., Ex. D at 8-9.) Plainti9 does not deny that he waived these constitutional issues in that hearing. In fact, he speci7cally acknowledges in his complaint that: Subsequent to questioning placed a knowing waiver to defendant's right to an Omnibus hearing on the record, at which time the issue of probable cause and confession could be raised. It is clear from the record that both the defendant and his attorney knew of the constitutional issues that could have been raised at an evidentiary hearing and that an evidentiary hearing might determine that the FBI agent had violated this [sic] 5th and 6th Amendment rights in conducting the interview in the manner it was conducted. (Compl. at 4.) Plainti9's guilty plea in state court must result in a waiver of the claims that he now attempts to raise. See Williams v. Scharo, 93 F.3d 527, 528 (8th Cir. 1996) (guilty plea forecloses subsequent § 1983 action). Under Minnesota law, and the law of the Eighth Circuit, a guilty plea entered by defendant represented by counsel \"operates as a waiver to all non-jurisdictional claims\" including constitutional claims. State of Minnesota v. Lothenbach, 296 N.W.2d 854, 857 (Minn. 1980); United States of America v. Vong, 171 F.3d 648, 654 (8th Cir. 1999). Minnesota's Supreme Court used the United States Supreme Court's words to describe the waiver e9ect of a guilty plea: A guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. When a criminal defendant had solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the o9ense with which he is charged, he may not therefore raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. Lothenbach, 296 N.W.2d at 857 (quoting Tollet v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973)). Moreover, long standing Minnesota law holds that all of plainti9's constitutional law claims fail because he waived them as part of his guilty plea. See State of Minnesota v. Murphy, 545 N.W.2d 909, 918 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 12/18 (Minn. 1996); State ex rel. Boswell v. Tahash, 278 Minn. 408, 415, 154 N.W.2d 813, 817 (1967). There is no dispute that the interview occurred before Jenson pleaded guilty in court. Plainti9 also acknowledges that when he entered that plea, he knowingly waived his right to challenge the alleged events of which he now complains. (See Compl. at 4.) On this basis, Jenson has waived any challenge to the underlying constitutionality of his interview with Agent Craft, and the court believes that defendants are entitled to summary judgment. IV. Other Bases Preclude Re-Litigation of Claim Arising From Interview Defendants also assert that Jenson is precluded from re-litigating the constitutionality of the August 25, 1999, interview on several other bases: (1) under the Rooker-Feldman Doctrine this court may not review a state court's proceeding that would e9ectively reverse the state court decision; (2) under the doctrine of collateral estoppel plainti9 is barred from re- litigating this matter; and (3) when considering the Supreme Court's decision in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), plainti9 is precluded from bringing this type of claim under § 1983. The court agrees with defendants that all of these bases provide further reason why plainti9's case fails. A. Rooker-Feldman Defendants correctly assert that plainti9's claim is barred by Rooker- Feldman. Under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, federal district courts do not have jurisdiction to review challenges to state court decisions. District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923). A federal action is precluded \"if the relief requested in the federal action would e9ectively reverse the state court decision or void its rulings.\" Charchenko v. City of Stillwater, 47 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir. 1995) (noting that \"the only court with jurisdiction to review decisions of state courts is the United States Supreme Court\"). In applying the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, a court must determine: 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 13/18 [E]xactly what the state court held and whether the relief requested by [plainti9] in his federal action require determining the state court's decision is wrong or would void its ruling. If the relief requested in the federal action requires determining that the state court decision is wrong or would void the state court's ruling, then the issues are inextricably intertwined and the district court has no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the suit. Id. The Eighth Circuit has further explained: [T]he federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it. Where federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court is wrong, it is di:cult to conceive the federal proceeding as, in the substance, anything other than a prohibited appeal of the state court judgment. Keene Corp. v. Cass, 908 F.2d 293, 296-297 (8th Cir. 1990) (citing Penzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 25 (1987)). The issues raised here by Jenson are premised on the claim that he was subjected to a custodial interrogation without access to his legal counsel. Jenson, however, entered into a plea agreement in state court and the court relied upon Jenson's waiver as a part of accepting his guilty plea, the plea agreement and when entering judgment against him. Clearly, plainti9's present federal claims are inextricably intertwined with the state court conviction. In order for Jenson to succeed in the present lawsuit, this court would have to 7nd that plainti9's constitutional rights were violated and that he did not waive in state court his right to challenge the confession arising out of the August 25, 1999, interview. The e9ect of such a 7nding would be to void or invalidate his guilty plea. In other words, in order for this case to proceed, this court would have to reverse the state court and set aside plainti9's plea. This is an action that is prohibited under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. As a result, the court concludes that plainti9's claims are precluded by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 14/18 B. Collateral Estoppel Defendants also correctly assert that plainti9 is barred by collateral estoppel. It is well settled that issues decided in state criminal proceedings may estop subsequent litigation for violations of civil rights under § 1983. See Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 104 (1980); Simmons v. O'Brien, 77 F.3d 1093, 1096 (8th Cir. 1996). Under the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, a federal court generally must a9ord a state court's determination the same preclusive a9ect that it would receive in the state's own courts. Marrese v. Am. Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380 (1985); Teleconnect Co. v. Ensrud, 55 F.3d 357, 361 (8th Cir. 1995). Federal courts look 7rst to the law of the state to \"promote comity between state and federal courts that has been recognized as a bulwark of the federal system.\" Allen, 449 U.S. at 96. Because state law applies, the court must examine Minnesota law and determine what preclusive e9ect its courts would give to plainti9's guilty plea and knowing waiver of any constitutional challenges to the August 25, 1999, interview. The standards for invoking collateral estoppel in Minnesota are set forth in Kaiser v. Northern States Power Co., 353 N.W.2d 899, 902 (Minn. 1984): 1. The issue is identical to one in a prior adjudication; 2. There was a 7nal judgment on the merits; 3. The estopped party was a party in privity with a party to the prior adjudication; and 4. The estopped party was given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the adjudicated issue. After careful review, the court has considered all four factors required for collateral estoppel and determines that all four factors are satis7ed here. Accordingly, plainti9 is barred from relitigating the constitutionality of the interview and his subsequent guilty plea. First, the Miranda issue was addressed in the state criminal proceeding. (See Transcript of Plea Hearing at 8-9.) Clearly, the claims that Jenson now asserts are identical to the ones that he could have raised in state court had 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 15/18 he not entered a guilty plea. Plainti9 and his attorneys had a full opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of his confession in state court but voluntarily chose to waive such challenge. Second, there was a 7nal judgment on the merits. The state court accepted plainti9's voluntary and counseled guilty plea. Plainti9 was sentenced. Plainti9 did not appeal. Third, the plainti9 was a party to, and the defendants are in privity with, the state court criminal proceeding. Fourth, plainti9 had a full and fair opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of his confession in the criminal proceeding. However, plainti9 chose not to challenge the constitutionality of his interrogation and confession in the state court proceeding, nor did he choose to appeal his voluntary and counseled guilty plea. Therefore, all four elements of collateral estoppel have been satis7ed, and plainti9 should not be allowed to re-litigate the constitutionality of his arrest and interrogation. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this basis. C. Heck Doctrine Defendants also correctly assert that plainti9's claims under § 1983 are precluded by the Supreme Court's holding in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994). In Heck, the Supreme Court held that to recover damages for an unconstitutional conviction or sentence, \"a section 1983 plainti9 must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on appeal, expunged by executive order, [or] declared invalid by a state court or in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.\" Until the conviction or sentence has been overturned, the claim is not cognizable under § 1983. See id. Here, for plainti9 to prevail he would need to negate the confession arising from the FBI interrogation and his subsequent guilty plea. Plainti9 fails to make such a showing. He never directly challenged his guilty plea and the court is not aware of any attempt to obtain habeas relief. As a consequence, the court concludes that Heck provides another basis for precluding plainti9's claims under § 1983 and granting defendants' motions.8 8 The court also notes that while defendants make persuasive arguments regarding the issue of immunity, the court will not address the immunity 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 16/18 Plainti9 also alleges that defendants violated provisions of the Minnesota State Constitution and various state statutes. Since this court is dismissing all of the federal claims, it concludes that it no longer has jurisdiction over the state law claims and these claims will be dismissed without prejudice. See 28 U.C. §§ 1367(a) and (c)(3); United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966); Richmond v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Minnesota, 957 F.2d 595, 598-99 (8th Cir. 1992). For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: issue given its determination to dismiss this case on the several bases already discussed. V. Minnesota State Law Claims 9 CONCLUSION 1. Defendants' motions to dismiss, or in the alternative for summary judgment [Docket Nos. 18, 21, 24, 28, 44 and 48], are granted; 2. Plainti9's Claims I, II, III, IV, V, VI of his complaint are dismissed with prejudice; and 3. Plainti9's Claims VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII of his complaint are dismissed without prejudice.

Paulsen, Assistant United States Attorney, United States Attorney's O:ce, 300 South Fourth Street, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55415 (for the Government); and Frederick J. Goetz, Goetz & Eckland PA, 43 Main Street Southeast, Suite 505, Minneapolis, MN 55414 (for Defendant). This matter is before the Court, United States Magistrate Judge Tony N. Leung, on Defendant's Motion to Suppress Statements (ECF No. 20) and Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of Search and Seizure (ECF No. 25). These motions have been referred to the undersigned for a report and recommendation to the district court, the Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, under 28 U.S.C. § 636 and D. Minn. LR 72.1(a)(3). A hearing was held on September 16, 2014. Assistant United States Attorney Je9rey S. Paulsen appeared on behalf of the United States of America (the Government). Attorney Frederick J. Goetz appeared on behalf of Defendant Fahad Abdihakim Diriye. The Court heard testimony from O:cer Scott Aikins of the Minneapolis Police Department. The Court received the following exhibits: Defendant's Exhibit 1, a *2  supplement report of Minneapolis Police O:cer John Staufenberg, and Defendant's Exhibit 2, a supplement report of Minneapolis Police O:cer Hien Dinh. 2 Post-hearing brie7ng is now complete and these motions are ripe for a determination by the Court. I. Based upon the 7le and documents contained therein, along with the testimony presented and exhibits received, the undersigned Magistrate Judge makes the following: FINDINGS On the evening of June 25, 2014, O:cer Aikins responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a parking lot at Thomas Beach near Lake Calhoun. The car was thought to be involved in an armed robbery  that occurred in 1 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 3/12 downtown Minneapolis a few days earlier. The robbery had taken place on June 22 and, on June 24, suspects in the robbery had been observed in the car. At the time, no suspects were in custody. The dispatch also indicated that a gun was possibly involved in the robbery. (Def. Ex. 1.) 1 At times, this incident is referred to as a robbery and, at other times, it is referred to as a burglary. For purposes of these motions, the precise crime is irrelevant. Three squads, including O:cer Aikins, arrived at the scene and parked approximately one to two squad-lengths away from the car. According to O:cer Aikins, law enforcement \"basically swarmed over the car.\" A man and a woman were ordered out of the car, handcu9ed, and placed in the responding squads. Approximately, 15 minutes later, while law enforcement was determining what to do with the car, another male, later identi7ed as Defendant, walked up to the car, opened the driver's door, and *3  began to get inside. (Id.) O:cers ran over to the car and ordered Defendant out. At the time, the car had not yet been searched or secured. 3 Defendant exited the vehicle with his hands up and was handcu9ed by O:cer Aikins. While Defendant and O:cer Aikins were standing next to the car, Defendant appeared to be continuously turning away from O:cer Aikins, trying to turn his right side away from O:cer Aikins. Defendant was told to settle down, but did not comply. O:cer Aikins was concerned that Defendant might be trying to grab a weapon and began patting him down. O:cer Aikins immediately felt a hard, L-shaped object in Defendant's pocket, which he recognized as a handgun. O:cer Aikins reached into Defendant's pocket and removed a loaded handgun. At the hearing, O:cer Aikins acknowledged that Defendant was not named in the dispatch, he did not observe Defendant commit any crime, he had no speci7c information linking Defendant to the car, he did not observe Defendant take anything out or put anything in the car, and Defendant did not try to 8ee. II. Based upon the foregoing Findings, the undersigned makes the following: 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 4/12 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Defendant asserts that law enforcement lacked reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity and moves for suppression of all evidence obtained as the result of his seizure and the statements he made to law enforcement during an interview *4  the day following.  Defendant argues that the dispatch on which law enforcement relied \"did not contain any individual suspect description []or any other information speci7c to [him] that connected him with the robbery,\" only the car. (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 7, ECF No. 32.) Defendant also argues that law enforcement did not have reasonable suspicion that the car was involved in the earlier robbery. In addition, Defendant argues that, even if law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to stop the car, it was not \"reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to seize anybody who might walk up to the vehicle and open a door some three days after the crime occurred.\" (Id. at 8.) 4 2 2 In Defendant's motion to suppress statements, Defendant identi7es both statements made on June 25 and during the interview on June 26. (Def.'s Mot. to Suppress Statements ¶ 1.) At the hearing, however, Defendant clari7ed that he was just challenging the June 26 statement.   -------- A. Investigatory Stop \"A police o:cer may conduct a brief, investigatory stop of an individual if the o:cer reasonably suspects that the individual is involved in criminal activity.\" United States v. Lawhorn, 735 F.3d 817, 820 (8th Cir. 2013) (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968)). \"Reasonable suspicion must be based on speci7c, articulable facts. In determining whether an o:cer had reasonable suspicion based on speci7c, articulable facts, [courts] look at the totality of the circumstances, allowing o:cers to draw on their experience and training.\" Id. (quotation and citation omitted). \"Reasonable suspicion does not require 'absolute[] certain[ty];' rather an o:cer must observe 'unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.'\" Id. at 821 (alteration in original) (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 27, 30). \"While reasonable suspicion must be more than an inchoate hunch, the Fourth *5  Amendment only requires that police articulate some minimal, objective justi7cation for an investigatory 5 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 5/12 stop.\" United States v. Walker, 555 F.3d 716, 719 (8th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). \"In deciding whether to conduct a Terry stop, an o:cer may rely on information provided by other o:cers as well as any information known to the team of o:cers conducting the investigation.\" United States v. Allen, 705 F.3d 367, 370 (8th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted). Similarly, \"[t]he Fourth Amendment permits an investigatory stop of a vehicle if o:cers have a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle or its occupants are involved in criminal activity. In such a case, o:cers may brie8y stop an individual and make reasonable inquiries aimed at con7rming or dispelling the suspicion.\" United States v. Smith, 648 F.3d 654, 658 (8th Cir. 2011) (quotations and citation omitted). At the time law enforcement approached the car, they knew that the car matched the description of a vehicle involved in a robbery occurring just a few days before for which no one was in custody. This information provided a reasonable basis to stop the car and its occupants to investigate possible associations with the robbery and con7rm or dispel suspicions regarding the car's involvement. Id.; see Lawhorn, 735 F.3d at 821 (reasonable suspicion existed to stop vehicle where \"upon arriving at the lot[,] the o:cers found a car matching the caller's description, shined a spotlight at the car, and observed the car's occupant to look back at them wide-eyed and reach quickly into the back seat\"); Allen, 705 F.3d at 370 (law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to stop SUV to investigate SUV's possible association with minivan where vehicles appeared to be travelling in tandem and large quantity of marijuana was found in minivan); see also *6  United States v. Marxen, 410 F.3d 326, 332 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"[W]e conclude that police are permitted to conduct a Terry stop to investigate completed felonies if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the vehicle stopped was involved in criminal activity and the stop may produce evidence of a crime even if o:cers do not have reasonable suspicion to believe that the owner and/or driver of the vehicle was directly involved in the criminal activity.\"). 6 Defendant argues that, even if there was reasonable suspicion to stop the car, there was no reasonable suspicion \"that [he] was involved in or wanted in connection with the robbery.\" (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 8.) The Government essentially concedes that law enforcement \"had no pre-existing 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 6/12 information tying [Defendant] to the armed robbery or the suspect vehicle.\" (Gov't's Mem. in Opp'n at 4, ECF No. 33.) The Government contends, however, that \"[D]efendant's own actions in entering the vehicle provided all the reasonable suspicion that was needed.\" (Id.) The Government contends that law enforcement could reasonably assume Defendant had \"some connection to the suspect vehicle or he would not have entered it. And, if [Defendant] was connected to the vehicle, there also was reasonable suspicion to believe he was connected to the robbery.\" (Id.) The Government also contends that because law enforcement \"had reason to believe there was a gun in the suspect vehicle\" and \"[t]hey had not searched the vehicle yet or secured it in any way,\" law enforcement had \"reasonable suspicion to believe [Defendant] was either trying to conceal or make o9 with evidence, or worse, attempting to access a weapon to use against the police.\" (Id. at 3.) *7 7 Defendant appears to be suggesting that his behavior was wholly innocent and that it is not \"reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to seize anybody who might walk up to . . . [a] vehicle and open a door some three days after the crime occurred.\" (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 8.) But \"[t]he behavior on which reasonable suspicion is grounded . . . need not establish that the suspect is probably guilty of a crime or eliminate innocent interpretations of the circumstances.\" United States v. Carpenter, 462 F.3d 891, 986 (8th Cir. 2006). Defendant walked up to a car believed to be involved in a recent armed robbery—a car which was essentially 8anked by squad cars—opened the driver's door, and began to seat himself in the vehicle. Based on Defendant's actions, it is not unreasonable to infer that he owned or had control over the car. It was reasonable for law enforcement to conclude that Defendant was associated with the car (and therefore potentially the robbery) and conduct a brief investigatory stop of Defendant to con7rm or dispel their suspicions. While there may be wholly innocent explanations for such conduct, it was not unreasonable under the circumstances for law enforcement to stop Defendant and investigate his connection to the car. Further, it was not unreasonable for law enforcement to handcu9 Defendant during the investigatory stop given the suspected use of a gun in the robbery they were investigating and the fact that law enforcement had not yet been able to clear the car (including removing any weapons present) after taking 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 7/12 the other two individuals into custody. See id. at 659 (\"As part of a lawful Terry stop, o:cers may take any measures that are reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\" (quotations omitted)); El-Ghazzawy v. Berthiaume, *8  363 F.3d 452, 457 (8th Cir. 2011) (\"'[F]or the use of handcu9s during a Terry stop, the Fourth Amendment requires some reasonable belief that the suspect is armed and dangerous or that the restraints are necessary for some other legitimate purpose, evaluated on the facts of each case.'\" (quoting Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 836 (6th Cir. 2005)). 8 Defendant likens this case to United States v. Hudson, 405 F.3d 425 (6th Cir. 2005). In Hudson, an armed robbery occurred at a convenience store in 2000. 405 F.3d at 428. Hudson, a black male, was identi7ed \"from a series of suspect photographs and a warrant was issued for [his] arrest.\" Id. at 428, 429, 433-34. Law enforcement was unable to locate Hudson. Id. at 428. Approximately one year later, the investigator received an anonymous tip from a colleague that a woman the investigator suspected was Hudson's girlfriend was working at another convenience store in the same town. Id. The tip stated that on a certain date, Hudson's girlfriend would arrive at the convenience store around 3:00 p.m. and be accompanied by Hudson. Id. In an e9ort to corroborate the tip, the investigator con7rmed the girlfriend's employment at the convenience store through the manager and learned that the girlfriend usually arrived ten minutes before her shift began. Id. at 428- 29. It was disputed whether the manager also con7rmed the type of car—a Ford Taurus—that Hudson's girlfriend drove. Id. at 429. In addition, based on his years as a police o:cer in the community, the investigator testi7ed that he knew that Hudson and his girlfriend were romantically involved and had a child. Id. Law enforcement set up at the convenience store to wait for Hudson's girlfriend to arrive. Id. Around 3:00 p.m., Hudson's girlfriend pulled into the parking lot in a Ford *9  Taurus. Id. She was accompanied by two black males and an infant. Id. Law enforcement \"approached the car with their 7rearms drawn in a so-called 'felony approach'\" because \"they suspected that Hudson might be armed since he had allegedly used a 7rearm to commit the robbery.\" Id. Only after the three individuals were searched and handcu9ed, 9 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 8/12 and crack cocaine discovered on Hudson's person, did law enforcement con7rm their identities. Hudson moved to suppress the crack cocaine. See id. at 439. The Sixth Circuit concluded that the district court erred in denying Hudson's motion because the investigative stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion. Id. The Sixth Circuit noted that \"the tipster's most critical assertion—that Hudson would be in the car\"—had been discredited because, \"[w]hile [the investigator] testi7ed that the tip had included this prediction, [the investigator's] report, which he composed soon after receipt of the tip, makes no reference to it.\" Id. at 433. The Sixth Circuit concluded that law enforcement \"had no more than a hunch that Hudson would be accompanying [his girlfriend] to work on the day in question and no more than a hunch that one of the passengers in [her] car was Hudson.\" Id. at 434. Such a \"hunch\" lacked the speci7c and articulable facts needed to form reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. Id.; see also id. at 438 (\" [T]he tip upon which the government relies did not mention Hudson and consequently o9ers no support for the government's contention that o:cers reasonably suspected that Hudson was in the car.\"). The Sixth Circuit reasoned that, *10 10 [a]t most, [the investigator's] previous knowledge of Hudson and [his girlfriend] furnished the o:cers with reasonable suspicion that the two were a couple and shared a child. It is a signi7cant, and unreasonable, leap to deduce from this that the two were traveling together to the [convenience store] on [a certain date]. The leap is not made any less unreasonable by the fact that the two men accompanying [Hudson's girlfriend] were black, as the investigators knew Hudson to be. Of course, had the o:cers positively, or at least reasonably, identi7ed Hudson as a passenger before approaching [his girlfriend's] car with their guns drawn—for example, by reference to a photograph of Hudson, or a composite drawing— they would have had reasonable suspicion to seize the car and its occupants. But, lacking reasonable suspicion, the o:cers elected to seize 7rst and identify second.  2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 9/12 Id. at 433-34 (footnoted omitted); see also id. at 438 (\"[T]he facts that Hudson is black and once had a relationship with [the girlfriend] do not provide a particularized basis for suspecting he was in the car.\"). The Sixth Circuit was also \"mindful that . . . [law enforcement] w[as] not attempting to solve a recently committed crime, or an ongoing one, but rather to arrest a person suspected of having committed a felony over a year earlier.\" Id. at 436-37. The Sixth Circuit observed that \"resolution of the question whether reasonable suspicion existed in the 7rst instance must be sensitive to whether the Terry stop was made to investigate a crime committed beyond the recent past.\" Id. at 437. Hudson is distinguishable in several respects. First, whereas over a year had passed between the armed robbery and the investigatory stop in Hudson, only a few days had passed between the armed robbery in this case and the investigatory stop of Defendant. Second, law enforcement had no reasonable suspicion for stopping the car in *11  Hudson. Before stopping the car, they did not con7rm that Hudson was in fact one of the passengers; they did not observe any violation of a tra:c law; and there was no indication that the car was connected to the crime under investigation. In this case, the car was the connection to the armed robbery. Third, Hudson engaged in no unusual conduct—he was merely a passenger in a vehicle. Here, Defendant walked up to a car that was 8anked by police o:cers, opened the driver's door, and began seating himself in the vehicle. Under the circumstances, Defendant's behavior was highly suspicious. Moreover, there is a question of o:cer safety in the present case. 11 Based on the totality of the circumstances, Defendant's conduct provided law enforcement with reasonable suspicion to stop Defendant and investigate his connection to the car. B. Statements \"If . . . [law enforcement] o:cers conduct an illegal search or detention, physical evidence from the search as well as verbal evidence obtained from the detention must be excluded as the 'fruits' of the o:cers' unlawful action.\" United States v. Cotter, 701 F.3d 544, 547 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 484-85 (1963)); accord United States v. Yousif, 2/22/2021 United States v.

Defendant's only argument for the suppression of his statements is that they were fruits of the illegal investigatory stop. (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 10-11.) Because the *12  Court concludes that the investigatory stop was proper under the Fourth Amendment, there is no basis upon which to suppress the statements. 12 III. Based upon the foregoing Findings and Conclusions, the undersigned Magistrate Judge makes the following: RECOMMENDATION For the reasons set forth herein, IT IS HEREBY RECOMMENDED that: 1.

      "Too_Long1    Arbitration   LELS (Mathew Aish)/Columbia Heights Police Department    Grievance Arbitration Between:        BMS Case No.: 20 PA-1575    Columbia Heights Police Dept. (Employer)   and   Law Enforcement Labor Services Inc. (LELS)  Mathew Aish (Grievant)     REPRESENTATION  Representing Columbia Heights Police Department  Joan Quade, Attorney   BARNA, GUZY & STEFFEN, LTD.    Representing Mathew Aish:  Renee Zachman, Attorney  Mark Schneider, Attorney  Law Enforcement Labor Services  ISSUE  Did the employer have Just Cause to Terminate Mathew Aish?  If not, what is the appropriate Remedy?    INTRODUCTION  Mathew Aish was a police officer in Columbia Heights hired in 1999 and terminated on January 15, 2020.  Law  Enforcement Labor Services responded to the termination by filing a step one grievance on January 27, 2020.  The termination stems primarily from an incident that occurred on October 27, 2019 in which the grievant,  Mathew Aish, responded to a dispatch call regarding a driver operating a vehicle recklessly on city streets in  2    Columbia Heights and Fridley. The description relayed by dispatch was that of a white Taurus driving at speeds  up to 80 miles per hour and traveling north in south bound lanes of traffic.   The concerns raised by the City leading to their decision to terminate revolve around the follow up reporting of  this incident by Mathew Aish including concerns of truthfulness, accuracy and complying with a direct order to  activate body worn camera at all times when engaging with non-departmental personnel. This direct order came  about as a result of a 2006 incident in which Mr. Aish had falsely represented the sobriety test of another police  officer from a neighboring jurisdiction.  Due to the dishonesty involved in that event Mr. Aish was determined,  by the Anoka County Attorney’s Office, to be Brady impaired. As result of this designation the City is  compelled to reveal the issues of Aish’s dishonesty to defense council when Mr. Aish is involved in the  prosecution of a crime.  As a result of the 2006 incident the City imposed a requirement that Mr. Aish activate  his body worn camera whenever interacting with non-departmental personnel in an effort to diminish credibility  questions that would likely arise at subsequent criminal proceedings that involved Mr. Aish testifying on behalf  of the City and to create a process that would enable the City to keep Mr. Aish employed.    An Arbitration hearing was held at the Columbia Heights Police Department offices on August 17 to 19, 2020.    FACTS  Mathew Aish was terminated on January 15, 2020 after 20 plus years of services as a police officer for the city  of Columbia Heights. The incident that is largely the basis for this termination occurred at approximately 2:30  PM that afternoon in which a Columbia Heights Dispatcher announced that there was a driver proceeding  recklessly on the streets of Columbia Heights. Two Columbia Heights police officers, Officer Joseph Pikala and  Officer Mathew Aish, responded separately to the radio call. Due to the positioning of their squads it was Aish  who was able first to get eyes on the reckless driver and position his squad behind the driver.  Aish provided the  radio contact after beginning to trail the reckless driver.  He explained that he was traveling north on Main street  crossing highway 694.  This triggered the movement and positioning of two Fridley squads, one driven by  3    Officer Elasky and the other driven by an officer in training, Officer Bulman accompanied in his squad by  Officer Fetrow. Both Fridley squads were positioned on Main Street facing south and waited as Aish following  the suspect drove by them northbound. Once the reckless driver reached the two Fridley squads the Fridley  officers turned on sirens, pulled a U turn and got in behind Aish. Almost immediately after the Fridley Squads  completed their U turns the reckless driver ran a stop sign and Aish followed right behind through that stop  sign.  Aish announced that the driver was speeding up and said “This is going to be a pursuit and I am getting  out.”  At that time Aish pulled over to the curb and the Two Fridley officers fell in behind the reckless driver.   Video footage from the rear of Officer Elasky’s car showed that once the Fridley squads passed Aish he pulled  back out into traffic and began to follow behind the Fridley squads.  It was clear in the rear camera video that  once back in the traffic Aish turned his light back on and began to follow.  GPS systems installed on the Fridley  squads also recorded the speed the cars were traveling indicating that they were moving as fast as 58 mph.  The  front view camera on Bulman’s car also clearly shows the reckless driver turning left and running an additional  stop sign and then turning right onto a residential street.  It was at this time Fridley officers talked about  conducting a PIT maneuver on the reckless driver.  Bulman who was first behind the reckless driver was unable  to do the PIT as Bulman was a trainee and not qualified to initiate a PIT. Elasky said he would PIT and  proceeded to pass Bulman and performed the PIT disabling the White Taurus. Immediately behind Elasky were  Bulman and Fetrow in a Fridley squad and right behind them, just seconds behind Elasky was Aish. All the  officers, including Aish, ran up to the disabled car with guns drawn.  Fetrow can be heard clearly screaming get  your hands up. The driver was immediately pulled from his car and apprehended.    Once the driver was cuffed he was immediately was put in a Fridley squad car. At this point body cameras  caught the debriefing that occurred amongst the officers.  It is clear that shortly after the offender is place in the  Fridley squad Aish turns off his body camera.  Elasky continues to run his body camera and it is clear on his  camera that Aish asks in a quiet tone, “Are you on?” referring to body camera.  Elasky say “yes” and apologizes  and explains that he has to stay on.   4    A few hours later Aish submits an incident report of the event referring the action as “Reckless driver  complaint/ assist to Fridley PD”. The report does not refer to the action as a pursuit and thus not prompting the  required state documentation of a pursuit. The city takes issue with charactorizing this as an assist to another  department and concludes that under Columbia Heights policy as well as State law this should have been filed  as a Pursuit report and a state report submitted.  Statements within the report that the City takes issue with are as  follows:  1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to  accelerate again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several  blocks now, I had been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to  continue and pulled over and let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to  accelerate northbound on Main Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the  suspect blow through the stop sign and intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop  (Emphasis added)  2) I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over and  stop. I followed at the posted speed limit (Emphasis Added).  3)  I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.  The  Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and Trinity. I  activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody (Emphasis added).  The City claims each of the above identified statements in the report are false and intentionally written that way  to minimize Aish’s involvement in the event and thus making the event not appear as though it was a pursuit. If  not a determined to be a pursuit then less reporting required and therefore no issue for failure to properly  document. The video footage from Fridley squads confirms the inaccuracies in Aish’s report.  Fridley squad  footage and corresponding sound recording clearly shows Aish following suspect blowing through the stop sign  at 57th Ave and stating suspect is accelerating and then stating he is pulling out.  Secondly, the reports states he  was following at the posted speed. The Fridley squad GPS computers record the vehicle speed. The computer  5    vehicle recorded speeds are contemporaneous with the video and show speeds of as much as 58 mph as the  Fridley squads pursued and at the same time also showed Aish following right behind.  In addition, the video  also shows Aish arriving within just a few seconds of the completed PIT once again indicating he would have  had to be moving as fast as the speeds of the recorded for the Fridley squads. Finally Aish reported that he did  not turn on his emergency lights until he was on Starlight Street and after the PIT was completed.  The rear  camera view from Office Elasky’s car shows he actually turned on his emergency lights shortly after the Fridley  squads passed him on Main Street and kept them on while following the Fridley squads.  In addition to vehicle video footage body camera footage was also presented at the hearing.  The body camera  footage from Officer Aish was turned on as Aish arrived at the scene where the suspect was apprehended.   Aish’s body camera remained on until the suspect was placed in the Fridley squad at which point he turned off  his camera.  Body camera video of Elasky remained on after Aish had turned his off.  It is clear in Elasky’s  video that Aish walks up to him and asks in a low voice if Elasky is “on” understood to mean is your body  camera on to which Elasky apologizes and says yes and indicates he is required to have it on. Elasky body  camera reveals that Aish did continue to have conversations with two Fridley officers about the events leading  to the PIT that this discussion was not recorded on Aish’s body-worn camera.  Evidence was also presented that  Aish had a follow up phone conversation with Officer Fetrow before the end of his shift that night, which was  not recorded.  The testimony of Aish indicated that he apologized about “dumping” the situation back to Fridley  but explained that he was feeling like there was a target on his back and he was not comfortable with his not  knowing the Fridley streets like the Fridley officers did.   Within an hour and a half of this incident the previously referenced report was written and submitted. The  report indicated it was an assist of another department never referring to the situation as a pursuit. This report  was later reviewed and approved by Columbia Heights Sargent Fischer in which he did not identify any issues  or concerns with the report.   The first identified concern regarding this incident came about by coincidence when Columbia Heights police  captain, Lenny Austin, ran into Sergeant Kevin Titus, of the Fridley police, who was at the Columbia Heights  6    police department looking for body camera footage of Aish as a follow up the to the report he was writing  regarding the pursuit on the 27th of October.  Austin was not aware of a pursuit that involved his department as  Aish’s report characterized the event as an assist to another police Department.  This sent up a red flag for  Austin and set the investigation in motion. Austin’s initial review of Aish’s report identified a peculiar set of  facts, Fridley reported the event as pursuit but Aish’s report indicated that he was following the suspect at the  pasted speed, it was this incongruous fact that raised a red flag. The ensuing investigation identified the  previously mentioned inconsistency in Aish’s report and several other concerns.   Aish has had a history involving serious issues with honesty to the point where the Anoka County Attorney has  deemed him to be Brady impaired. Brady impairment is a label placed on police officers that have had an  incident of dishonesty in their work history as a police officer.  If a police officer is classified as Brady impaired  the prosecution is required to reveal to the defense the honesty issues associated with the police officer which  can impact that officer’s credibility and thus their effectiveness as a witness if criminal prosecution. The  incident leading to Aish’s Brady impairment designation dates back to 2006 yet the designation as Brady  impaired was not imposed until 2017.   The 2006 incident involved a Minneapolis police officer who had been arrested the night before and had his  service revolver confiscated by the Columbia Heights police.  He returned to the Columbia Heights police  department the following morning to get his gun returned. He was acquainted with Officer Aish through their  Minneapolis Police Academy training course years earlier.  When he arrived to get his gun returned Corporal  Bonesteel informed Aish not to give the Minneapolis officer his revolver if he did not register a 0.0 on the  portable breath test. Aish went outside to administer the portable breath test (BPT) on the officer and then  reported back to Bonesteel that the officer was Ok to drive and that he had blown a .04. A few minutes later he  reported to Captain Lenny Austin that the Minneapolis officer blew a .06.  Bonesteel asked Aish to return to  give him the (BPT). Bonesteel knowing that the device saves the most recent test took a look at the BPT and  discovered that the officer actually blew a.097 exceeding the legal limit to drive and not what Aish had reported  to both him and to the Captain.  The department took action based on this dishonesty and gave Aish a 13 day  7    suspension. However, no determination was made that Aish’s dishonesty warranted the designation of Brady  impaired.    The Brady impairment designation came about in 2017 when a Public Defender, responding to concerns  expressed by his client, regarding the treatment he received form Mr. Aish when he was arrested prompted the  Public Defender to request a look at Mr. Aish’s Disciplinary file. It was the Public Defender, upon discovering  the 2006 incident of dishonesty, sought to have a Brady impairment designation applied to Mr. Aish.  The  Anoka County Attorney reviewed the claim and determined that Aish was indeed Brady impaired as a result of  the 2006 infraction.    The city was at that point of trying to determine if Mr. Aish could still effectively continue with the Columbia  Heights police force or would this impairment make him effectively useless when testifying for the prosecution.  The City decided not to terminate Mr. Aish but rather imposed a specific order directing his performance going  forward. On May 31, 2017 the city imposed upon Mr. Aish the following order:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.      It was this order, going forward, that would govern how Officer Aish would go about performing his  work as a Columbia Heights Police Officer and it was the Cities determination that Aish’s lack of  compliance with this order that led in large part  to the City’s decision to terminate Officer Aish.  As a result of the concerns raised by Aish’s reporting of this incident the department conducted an audit  of Aish’s reporting for the months leading up to this event and determined that there had been two  additional reporting inconsistencies by Aish in violation of Columbia Heights policies.  Both involved  8    domestic situations, one on September 5, 2019 and once on September 9, 2019, in which the city claims,  per policy, written reports were required for but Aish only documented the situations with notes entered  into the CAD.    On July 12, of 2017, less than 2 months from the date this order was imposed, the grievant received a  written warning, in part, for failing to comply with the May 31, 2017 written order relating to activating  body-worn camera.  This event involved a domestic dispute in which Mr. Aish either failed to activate the  camera when gathering information from a domestic abuse complainant or failed to properly label his  body-worn camera video evidence so it would be properly retained and could be used by the prosecution  at a later date. The written reprimand imposed also included a warning to Aish that “Further violations of  these or other policies could lead to more severe discipline including written reprimand, suspension or  termination.”    RELEVANT POLICIES  101:13 Knowledge Policies, Procedures, Statutes and Ordinances  Whether on duty or off duty, all employees shall establish and maintain a working knowledge of  departmental and divisional policies and procedures, and the relevant statutes and ordinances where  applicable.

The reason for the pursuit, including specifically what information the officer knew at the  time the pursuit began.   2.  The route of the pursuit as best can be recalled     3.  Traffic conditions, presence and location of citizens.   4.  Any violations the driver of the fleeing vehicle committed during the pursuit.   5.   Other Columbia Heights squads involved and any other agencies.   6.  Damage to any vehicle, property, and/or injury to any person.   7.  Supervisor on duty at time of the pursuit.   8.   Road and weather conditions.   9.  Time pursuit began and ended.   10.  How, where, and why the pursuit concluded or was abandoned.   11.   Charges filed, if any.     B.  The primary officer must also complete the Minnesota Pursuit Reporting Form as required by  Statute §626.5531. If the primary officer is unable to complete this form, the form shall be filled out by the  supervisor or senior officer on duty.     C.   The Pursuit will be reviewed and critiqued by a Captain, and will include the supervisor, and  officers involved as soon after the incident as possible. The Captain will submit a summary of the critique  and applicable reports will be forwarded to the Chief of Police. The critique will be done and applicable  reports submitted for administrative uses, identification of training needs, and/or policy modification.     EMPLOYER’S ARGUMENT  11    The grievant has a history of deceptive and untruthful behavior that has clearly been documented in the  past and was clearly evident in the events leading to this termination.  The evidence identifying the  grievant’s untruthfulness in this case cannot be refuted as it was collected from unbiased officer worn- body cameras, Squad car videos, and computer generated data from squad on board computers. This  information is reinforced by direct testimony of witnesses and indisputable common sense. The grievant’s  past dishonesty requires no more evidence than the unequivocal fact that he was determined to be Brady  Impaired by the Anoka County Attorney’s office in 2017.  The designation of Brady Impairment is  applied when a police officer has been proven to have engaged in acts of dishonesty and thus their status  of Brady impaired must be identified to criminal defense attorneys  enabling an attack on the credibility  of that officers testimony.     Officer Aish was disciplined in 2006, receiving a 13 day suspension, for lying to both his supervisor and  to the Captain of the Columbia Heights Police Department regarding a breathalyzer test he performed on  a fellow officer from the Minneapolis Police Department. He was told not to return a confiscated service  revolver to that officer if the officer failed the breathalyzer test. Aish reported back to his supervisor that  the officer was .04 and reported to the Captain that he was .06 but in actuality the test results were a .097  which clearly would not warrant return of the revolver. The PBT (Portable Breathalyzer Test) stored the  most recent test conducted and it was from that that Aish was caught being untruthful to his superiors.    The Brady label was not applied in 2006 however, but rather came about serendipitously when a public  defender requested Aish’s disciplinary file in response to concerns that defense had regarding the way  Aish had treated their client. It was that inquiry that the brought Aish’s 2006 discipline into focus and  resulted in the Anoka County Attorney’s determination that Aish was Brady impaired.   The Columbia Heights Police Department at that point had to determine what the impact would be on the  department as a result of this Brady determination and could Aish continue to work for the department.   12    The City decided not to terminate Aish, but rather attempted to deal with the very serious credibility issue  Aish now presented by imposing the following order:   Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.    The department viewed this order as critical for Aish’s continued employment and that this order was in  effect a “Last Chance Agreement” for Mr. Aish.     Aish’s clear violation of this order and his dishonesty was readily evidenced through an investigation that  included a review of Aish’s body-worn camera, Fridley officer’s body camera, Fridley squad cameras, on  board computers, and dispatch recordings. This data revealed that Mr. Aish, turned off his body camera  while continuing to discuss the pursuit with Fridley officers and in three different places in his subsequent  reporting of the event revealed that he intentionally misrepresented the facts of the pursuit in an effort to  diminish the severity of the event and his involvement. The reason he did this was to justify reporting it as  an “Assist to another police department” rather than properly reporting the events as a pursuit which it  certainly was under Columbia Heights policy and state law.  By minimizing the event and documenting it  as an “Assist to another Department” it would severely diminish the scrutiny the report would be subject  to by leadership in the Columbia Height Police Department.   Following are three excerpts taken from Aish’s report which are irrefutable misrepresentations of the  actual facts:   1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to accelerate  again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several blocks now, I had  been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to continue and pulled over and  13    let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to accelerate northbound on Main  Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the suspect blow through the stop sign and  intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop (Emphasis added).    The camera squad video from Fridley officer Bulman’s car clearly shows that Aish did not pull over prior to the  suspect blowing through the stop sign at 57th Ave. rather the video is clear that Aish follows suspect right  through the stop sign and then verbalizes that suspect is picking up speed and then acknowledges that this is  going to be a pursuit and I am getting out.     The second misrepresentation in the report is his incorrect documenting of his speed. Stating:  2) “I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over  and stop. I followed at the posted speed limit.” (Emphasis added)    Once again this is not true.  The Fridley squad cars are equipped with a computer GPS system that tracks the  speed of the vehicle and is shown contemporaneously with the squad video which clearly reveals that Bulman’s  vehicle was reaching speeds of 58 miles per hour nearly two time the posted speed limit leading up to the PIT  maneuver.   At the same time the Elasky rear squad video also shows Aish trailing the two Fridley vehicles but  maintaining the same distance behind indicating that his vehicle would have to be traveling at the roughly the  same speed. Finally, the squad video at the scene of the PIT maneuver shows Aish arriving within just a couple  of seconds after Bulman’s car arrives confirming that Aish would have necessarily been traveling at up to 58  miles per hour in order to arrive immediately after the Fridley squads.    Aish does not contradict this undeniable video evidence rather concludes that he was mistaken.  He said he was  so focused on the work at hand that he did not look down to track his speed and it just felt like they were  moving at a slow pace. Frist, officers are trained to keep tract of this type of information and an officer of 20  years should certainly be able to track his speed in this situation.  In fact if, as he claimed, this was a very slow  following there was nothing that should have been that adrenalin producing that should have so effected his  ability to recognize or tract the speed at which he was traveling.  In addition, if he was not sure of his speed he  should not be claiming he was traveling at the posted speed limit he should have explained that he was not sure.  14    In addition Aish testified that he was not sure exactly what the speed limit was on the streets he was traveling.   Also, his claim defies common sense.  We all have driven automobiles and we all can tell when we are traveling  at a high rate of speed. Without tracking his speed he should certainly have known he was not moving at the  posted speed. His claim does not seem like a mistake rather an intentional misrepresentation.    The third misrepresentation in his report is that he stated:  3) I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.   The Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and  Trinity. I activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody  (Emphasis added).    Once again the misrepresentation of the timing of Aish activating his emergency lights is also captured  on Fridley squad video.  While Aish claimed he did not activate his emergency lights until he arrived at  the scene, after the PIT was completed, the Fridley squad rear camera video irrefutably proves  otherwise.  Rear camera video from Elasky’s squad shows that after the Fridley squads passed Aish’s  squad which had been pulled over to the curb Aish then pulls away from the curb immediately after the  Fridley squads pass him.  The video also clearly shows that Aish activates his emergency lights shortly  after pulling out which was well before the PIT occurred as documented by Aish.    All three of these misrepresentations tend to downplay the seriousness of the event, the role in which  Aish played in this process and the likelihood his portrayal of the facts would lead anyone to believe  that he had been involved in a pursuit.  Aish does not document the event as a pursuit and rather drafts a  report labeling it as an “Assist” to another department to ensure the lower level of scrutiny by his  supervisors.  Originally, Aish’s plan would have worked for him and the report would have gone  unchallenged had it not been for the purely coincidental encounter between Chief Lenny Austin had  with Fridley Police Sargent Titus when the two bumped into each other at the Columbia Heights police  department in which Titus explained that he was seeking documentation of a pursuit. Austin found it  troubling to hear that there was a Pursuit involving his department and he had not been made aware of  15    the “Pursuit.”  It was only a result of this chance encounter that prompted the ensuing investigation of  Aish leading ultimately his termination.      The Columbia Heights policies very clearly defines “Pursuit”  Columbia Heights policy  603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.   All of the elements of the policy have been met under the facts laid out. The Union however claimed that  these facts failed to establish a pursuit. The union argues first that this was merely a failure to stop not a  felony fleeing as the suspect never acknowledged or made any gesture indicating he was aware of Aish’s  presence. Without such awareness by the suspect the Union concludes that this was not fleeing thus there  was no violation of law as required by the policy. Neither under the policy nor under state law is there any  requirement that the suspect make some gesture to indicate they know they are being followed.   The state law defines fleeing as follows:   “To increase speed, extinguish motor vehicle headlights or taillights, refuse to stop the  vehicle, or use other means with intent to attempt to elude a peace officer following a  signal given by the peace officer to the driver of a motor vehicle.”    Contrary to the Union’s claim, each element of the State’s definition of “Pursuit” has been met as well as  meeting all the requirements the City’s Pursuit policy. While the objective evidence presented at the hearing  clearly shows that a pursuit occurred it is equally clear that Aish’s misrepresentations in his report  intentionally attempts to blur the fact that there was a fleeing.  An element of fleeing is that the driver  “Increases speed” thus Aish misrepresented that he was traveling at the speed limit.  Fleeing also requires  an evasive maneuver by the suspect thus Aish documents that he pulled out of the pursuit before the driver  ran through the stop sign at 57th Ave. thus before the evasive maneuver occurred and that also was not true.  In addition, he failed to document that he was traveling at nearly 2 times the speed limit which is also an  16    evasive maneuver.  Finally he said he did not turn on his emergency lights until he arrived at the scene of  the PIT once the suspect was apprehended. Also not true.  He turned on his lights and kept them on the  entire time he followed the Fridley officers pursuing suspect.  His failure to document accurately as to when  he activated his lights is another dishonest attempt to avoid any conclusion that Aish’s actions met the  Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy which requires activating emergency lights.   While the Union claims the “Violation of the law” requirement in the Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy  is a requirement to have a fleeing as defined by state law there is no such reference to a fleeing requirement  in the policy. The policy merely requires “Failure to stop as required by law” Minnesota law requires that  vehicles pull over and stop on the side of the road when approached by a police vehicle with its lights and  siren are activated. Minn. Stat. §§ 169.20, subd. 5; 169.011. The suspect did not do this thus his actions are  a pursuit under the Columbia Heights policy, regardless of whether there was a fleeing and thus should  have been reported as a pursuit.    The Pursuit reporting requirement of Columbia Heights policy 603:06 (See below) was also clearly violated  when Aish failed to document the Pursuit according to the policy.  Not only do his actions violate Columbia  Heights policy they also violate Minnesota Statute §626.5531 as all pursuits must be documented with the  state.    Columbia Heights Policy 603:06 Reporting and Review   At the conclusion of any pursuit initiated or participated in, the primary officer in the pursuit  - or if the primary officer is unable to complete the report, the supervisor or senior officer on  duty - must complete a report. This information may be incorporated into any other report  prepared by the primary officer the report shall minimally include: (Emphasis added)  1.    The reason for the pursuit, including specifically what information the officer knew at  the time the pursuit began.   2.  The route of the pursuit as best can be recalled   3.  Traffic conditions, presence and location of citizens.   17    4.  Any violations the driver of the fleeing vehicle committed during the pursuit.   5.   Other Columbia Heights squads involved and any other agencies.   6.  Damage to any vehicle, property, and/or injury to any person.   7.  Supervisor on duty at time of the pursuit.   8.   Road and weather conditions.   9.  Time pursuit began and ended.   10.  How, where, and why the pursuit concluded or was abandoned.   11.   Charges filed, if any.     B.  The primary officer must also complete the Minnesota Pursuit Reporting Form as  required by Statute §626.5531. If the primary officer is unable to complete this form, the form  shall be filled out by the supervisor or senior officer on duty.     C.   The Pursuit will be reviewed and critiqued by a Captain, and will include the  supervisor, and officers involved as soon after the incident as possible. The Captain will submit  a summary of the critique and applicable reports will be forwarded to the Chief of Police. The  critique will be done and applicable reports submitted for administrative uses, identification  of training needs, and/or policy modification.       Aish’s actions were clearly insubordination as he violated a direct order regarding body-worn camera  and phone call recordings. The order states:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  A clear violation of this direct order is easily seen when reviewing Aish’s body-worn camera which  shows Aish turning off his camera once the suspect is apprehended. Other officers at the scene clearly  continue to run their cameras and in fact Aish asks in a low voice to Officer Elasky “Are you on?”   Elasky says “Yes” and apologizes. Further he explains that he has to keep his on. Even with all this  Aish does not activate his camera while continuing to debrief about the event.  A second violation of  18    this order occurs a few hours later as Aish phones Fridley Officer Fetrow, without recording it, and  once again discusses the Pursuit and apologizes for his needing to get out of the pursuit.     In 2017 Aish believed he was going to be terminated as a result of his Brady impairment.  The  Department decided not to terminate but imposed this very clear and very strict order to record outside  interactions.  It was understood that this was a last chance for Aish to keep his job.  Failing to comply,  as indicted in the order, could cause his termination.  He understood that he could be fired for non- compliance but that did not stop him. Aish claims that former Chief Nadeau, prior to retiring, had soften  the adherence to the policy recognizing that under certain situations the recording was not required  when interacting with other departments.  The Union however chose not have Nadeau testify to such  modifications and no written modifications of the order were presented at the hearing.  Beyond that,  here was a situation in which there was a high speed pursuit of a reckless driver in a residential area.   Apprehension of the suspect followed a risky PIT maneuver which was followed by all officers at the  scene, including Aish, pulled out their guns and forcefully removed the suspect from his car.  Under no  circumstances would this have ever led anyone to the conclusion that any follow up debriefing between  the two police departments was the type of interaction that would not need to be captured by Aish under  his 2017 order.     UNION’S ARGUMENT  The employer fails all sense of objectivity when analyzing the facts of this case and only interprets  them only through a lens of a strong predisposition to view the grievant, Mathew Aish, as dishonest  causing the employer to view as a lie any honest explainable mistakes.  Clear evidence of the  employer’s effort to judge all the actions associated with this event in a light most unfavorable to Aish  the employer, without seeking any clarification or confirmation from Officer Elasky, jumped to the  conclusion that when Elasky touched his body-worn camera at the time Aish asked if he were “On” the  employer wrongly concluded that Elasky was book marking this point on his video as it was a  19    suspicious question to be asked. The truth of this action was revealed through Elasky’s testimony at the  hearing revealing that it was an innocent reflex action Elasky had developed regarding his body-worn  camera and in no way was evidence of his concern and his need to bookmark.  Quite the opposite was  the testimony of both Fetrow and Elasky in that they both explained that it is quite common for officers  to ask if another is “On” but not for nefarious reasons but rather to know so they can prevent expressing  themselves in a way they would rather not have captured on video.    Mathew Aish was a police officer in the Columbia Heights police department for over 20 years.  In  2006 he was disciplined for his dishonesty and has learned the hard way from his mistake. Since that  day Aish has never shied away from letting others, especially new officers, hear about his troubles in an  effort to help them learn from his mistake as he has.     This was not a pursuit under the Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy and there was no fleeing with  respect to Officer Aish under the state law.  The employer insists on an interpretation of “fleeing” and “pursuit” that defies logic. The employer  maintains a position as to what is a pursuit that runs completely contrary to the opinions of their  officers, Fridley officers, as well as the opinion of a recognized expert Peter Dahl.   Further, the employer fails to accept the logical interpretation of the facts surrounding the events on  October 27, 2019 and rather insists on labeling these as acts of dishonesty worthy of termination.  The  employer takes this unrelenting position even in light of the expert testimony of Peter Dahl who  provided a reasonable and logical explanation for Aish’s documentation of the events of October 27,  2019 that does not include any acts of dishonesty on Aish’s part. Mr. Dahl is currently an adjunct  instructor at Dakota County Technical College teaching Law Enforcement Customized Training,  including basic and advanced law enforcement including driving involving pursuit and related issues.    Columbia Heights pursuit policy reads as follows:   20    603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Expert witness Dahl carefully reviewed all the evidence including squad video and provided an expert opinion  that within a reasonable degree of police certainty Aish had not participated in a pursuit. Under the policy there  are three required elements.  1) Attempt to stop the vehicle  2) Police squad lights and siren must be on   3) Vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Dahl testified that the third element, fails to stop as required by law, was not met under these facts.  Dahl  testified that “Under the Law” is clearly a reference to the state law relating to fleeing, Fleeing therefore  requires an attempt by the suspect to “Elude a peace officer” and that was not present.  Aish speeding up to get  in position to follow the suspect is not a pursuit as was confirmed by the testimony of Fridley Officer Fetrow.   A pursuit requires an attempt to elude the officer and that did not occur.  The suspect never acknowledged the  officers presence as per the testimony of Aish who said the driver never looked in rear mirror or in any other  way gave any indication that he knew he was being followed.  He was never focused on the police car behind  him.  Fridley Officers Fetrow and Elasky confirmed this saying they could see the driver’s face as he passed  them on Main Street and testified that he had a “Fixed 1000-yard stare” indicating he in no way was aware of  the police car behind him. Consequently, from the time Aish got behind the suspect there were no eluding  maneuvers or even increased speed to suggest the driver was aware of the police officer much less trying to  elude the peace officer.  Once it appeared as though the suspect became aware of Aish. Officer Aish bowed out  of the process acknowledging the situation stating to dispatch “This is going to be a pursuit, I am getting out.”  Up until this point there was no fleeing therefore no “Violation of the law” thus the elements of Columbia  Heights pursuit policy had not been met according to the expert testimony of Peter Dahl. Dahl continues by  refuting the interpretation provided by the City in which the City claims that it is a violation of the law if a  driver does not pull over for an emergency vehicle.  Dahl explains that the law referenced by the employer was\n"

      "Too_Long1    Arbitration   LELS (Mathew Aish)/Columbia Heights Police Department    Grievance Arbitration Between:        BMS Case No.: 20 PA-1575    Columbia Heights Police Dept. (Employer)   and   Law Enforcement Labor Services Inc. (LELS)  Mathew Aish (Grievant)     REPRESENTATION  Representing Columbia Heights Police Department  Joan Quade, Attorney   BARNA, GUZY & STEFFEN, LTD.    Representing Mathew Aish:  Renee Zachman, Attorney  Mark Schneider, Attorney  Law Enforcement Labor Services  ISSUE  Did the employer have Just Cause to Terminate Mathew Aish?  If not, what is the appropriate Remedy?    INTRODUCTION  Mathew Aish was a police officer in Columbia Heights hired in 1999 and terminated on January 15, 2020.  Law  Enforcement Labor Services responded to the termination by filing a step one grievance on January 27, 2020.  The termination stems primarily from an incident that occurred on October 27, 2019 in which the grievant,  Mathew Aish, responded to a dispatch call regarding a driver operating a vehicle recklessly on city streets in  2    Columbia Heights and Fridley. The description relayed by dispatch was that of a white Taurus driving at speeds  up to 80 miles per hour and traveling north in south bound lanes of traffic.   The concerns raised by the City leading to their decision to terminate revolve around the follow up reporting of  this incident by Mathew Aish including concerns of truthfulness, accuracy and complying with a direct order to  activate body worn camera at all times when engaging with non-departmental personnel. This direct order came  about as a result of a 2006 incident in which Mr. Aish had falsely represented the sobriety test of another police  officer from a neighboring jurisdiction.  Due to the dishonesty involved in that event Mr. Aish was determined,  by the Anoka County Attorney’s Office, to be Brady impaired. As result of this designation the City is  compelled to reveal the issues of Aish’s dishonesty to defense council when Mr. Aish is involved in the  prosecution of a crime.  As a result of the 2006 incident the City imposed a requirement that Mr. Aish activate  his body worn camera whenever interacting with non-departmental personnel in an effort to diminish credibility  questions that would likely arise at subsequent criminal proceedings that involved Mr. Aish testifying on behalf  of the City and to create a process that would enable the City to keep Mr. Aish employed.    An Arbitration hearing was held at the Columbia Heights Police Department offices on August 17 to 19, 2020.    FACTS  Mathew Aish was terminated on January 15, 2020 after 20 plus years of services as a police officer for the city  of Columbia Heights. The incident that is largely the basis for this termination occurred at approximately 2:30  PM that afternoon in which a Columbia Heights Dispatcher announced that there was a driver proceeding  recklessly on the streets of Columbia Heights. Two Columbia Heights police officers, Officer Joseph Pikala and  Officer Mathew Aish, responded separately to the radio call. Due to the positioning of their squads it was Aish  who was able first to get eyes on the reckless driver and position his squad behind the driver.  Aish provided the  radio contact after beginning to trail the reckless driver.  He explained that he was traveling north on Main street  crossing highway 694.  This triggered the movement and positioning of two Fridley squads, one driven by  3    Officer Elasky and the other driven by an officer in training, Officer Bulman accompanied in his squad by  Officer Fetrow. Both Fridley squads were positioned on Main Street facing south and waited as Aish following  the suspect drove by them northbound. Once the reckless driver reached the two Fridley squads the Fridley  officers turned on sirens, pulled a U turn and got in behind Aish. Almost immediately after the Fridley Squads  completed their U turns the reckless driver ran a stop sign and Aish followed right behind through that stop  sign.  Aish announced that the driver was speeding up and said “This is going to be a pursuit and I am getting  out.”  At that time Aish pulled over to the curb and the Two Fridley officers fell in behind the reckless driver.   Video footage from the rear of Officer Elasky’s car showed that once the Fridley squads passed Aish he pulled  back out into traffic and began to follow behind the Fridley squads.  It was clear in the rear camera video that  once back in the traffic Aish turned his light back on and began to follow.  GPS systems installed on the Fridley  squads also recorded the speed the cars were traveling indicating that they were moving as fast as 58 mph.  The  front view camera on Bulman’s car also clearly shows the reckless driver turning left and running an additional  stop sign and then turning right onto a residential street.  It was at this time Fridley officers talked about  conducting a PIT maneuver on the reckless driver.  Bulman who was first behind the reckless driver was unable  to do the PIT as Bulman was a trainee and not qualified to initiate a PIT. Elasky said he would PIT and  proceeded to pass Bulman and performed the PIT disabling the White Taurus. Immediately behind Elasky were  Bulman and Fetrow in a Fridley squad and right behind them, just seconds behind Elasky was Aish. All the  officers, including Aish, ran up to the disabled car with guns drawn.  Fetrow can be heard clearly screaming get  your hands up. The driver was immediately pulled from his car and apprehended.    Once the driver was cuffed he was immediately was put in a Fridley squad car. At this point body cameras  caught the debriefing that occurred amongst the officers.  It is clear that shortly after the offender is place in the  Fridley squad Aish turns off his body camera.  Elasky continues to run his body camera and it is clear on his  camera that Aish asks in a quiet tone, “Are you on?” referring to body camera.  Elasky say “yes” and apologizes  and explains that he has to stay on.   4    A few hours later Aish submits an incident report of the event referring the action as “Reckless driver  complaint/ assist to Fridley PD”. The report does not refer to the action as a pursuit and thus not prompting the  required state documentation of a pursuit. The city takes issue with charactorizing this as an assist to another  department and concludes that under Columbia Heights policy as well as State law this should have been filed  as a Pursuit report and a state report submitted.  Statements within the report that the City takes issue with are as  follows:  1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to  accelerate again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several  blocks now, I had been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to  continue and pulled over and let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to  accelerate northbound on Main Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the  suspect blow through the stop sign and intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop  (Emphasis added)  2) I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over and  stop. I followed at the posted speed limit (Emphasis Added).  3)  I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.  The  Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and Trinity. I  activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody (Emphasis added).  The City claims each of the above identified statements in the report are false and intentionally written that way  to minimize Aish’s involvement in the event and thus making the event not appear as though it was a pursuit. If  not a determined to be a pursuit then less reporting required and therefore no issue for failure to properly  document. The video footage from Fridley squads confirms the inaccuracies in Aish’s report.  Fridley squad  footage and corresponding sound recording clearly shows Aish following suspect blowing through the stop sign  at 57th Ave and stating suspect is accelerating and then stating he is pulling out.  Secondly, the reports states he  was following at the posted speed. The Fridley squad GPS computers record the vehicle speed. The computer  5    vehicle recorded speeds are contemporaneous with the video and show speeds of as much as 58 mph as the  Fridley squads pursued and at the same time also showed Aish following right behind.  In addition, the video  also shows Aish arriving within just a few seconds of the completed PIT once again indicating he would have  had to be moving as fast as the speeds of the recorded for the Fridley squads. Finally Aish reported that he did  not turn on his emergency lights until he was on Starlight Street and after the PIT was completed.  The rear  camera view from Office Elasky’s car shows he actually turned on his emergency lights shortly after the Fridley  squads passed him on Main Street and kept them on while following the Fridley squads.  In addition to vehicle video footage body camera footage was also presented at the hearing.  The body camera  footage from Officer Aish was turned on as Aish arrived at the scene where the suspect was apprehended.   Aish’s body camera remained on until the suspect was placed in the Fridley squad at which point he turned off  his camera.  Body camera video of Elasky remained on after Aish had turned his off.  It is clear in Elasky’s  video that Aish walks up to him and asks in a low voice if Elasky is “on” understood to mean is your body  camera on to which Elasky apologizes and says yes and indicates he is required to have it on. Elasky body  camera reveals that Aish did continue to have conversations with two Fridley officers about the events leading  to the PIT that this discussion was not recorded on Aish’s body-worn camera.  Evidence was also presented that  Aish had a follow up phone conversation with Officer Fetrow before the end of his shift that night, which was  not recorded.  The testimony of Aish indicated that he apologized about “dumping” the situation back to Fridley  but explained that he was feeling like there was a target on his back and he was not comfortable with his not  knowing the Fridley streets like the Fridley officers did.   Within an hour and a half of this incident the previously referenced report was written and submitted. The  report indicated it was an assist of another department never referring to the situation as a pursuit. This report  was later reviewed and approved by Columbia Heights Sargent Fischer in which he did not identify any issues  or concerns with the report.   The first identified concern regarding this incident came about by coincidence when Columbia Heights police  captain, Lenny Austin, ran into Sergeant Kevin Titus, of the Fridley police, who was at the Columbia Heights  6    police department looking for body camera footage of Aish as a follow up the to the report he was writing  regarding the pursuit on the 27th of October.  Austin was not aware of a pursuit that involved his department as  Aish’s report characterized the event as an assist to another police Department.  This sent up a red flag for  Austin and set the investigation in motion. Austin’s initial review of Aish’s report identified a peculiar set of  facts, Fridley reported the event as pursuit but Aish’s report indicated that he was following the suspect at the  pasted speed, it was this incongruous fact that raised a red flag. The ensuing investigation identified the  previously mentioned inconsistency in Aish’s report and several other concerns.   Aish has had a history involving serious issues with honesty to the point where the Anoka County Attorney has  deemed him to be Brady impaired. Brady impairment is a label placed on police officers that have had an  incident of dishonesty in their work history as a police officer.  If a police officer is classified as Brady impaired  the prosecution is required to reveal to the defense the honesty issues associated with the police officer which  can impact that officer’s credibility and thus their effectiveness as a witness if criminal prosecution. The  incident leading to Aish’s Brady impairment designation dates back to 2006 yet the designation as Brady  impaired was not imposed until 2017.   The 2006 incident involved a Minneapolis police officer who had been arrested the night before and had his  service revolver confiscated by the Columbia Heights police.  He returned to the Columbia Heights police  department the following morning to get his gun returned. He was acquainted with Officer Aish through their  Minneapolis Police Academy training course years earlier.  When he arrived to get his gun returned Corporal  Bonesteel informed Aish not to give the Minneapolis officer his revolver if he did not register a 0.0 on the  portable breath test. Aish went outside to administer the portable breath test (BPT) on the officer and then  reported back to Bonesteel that the officer was Ok to drive and that he had blown a .04. A few minutes later he  reported to Captain Lenny Austin that the Minneapolis officer blew a .06.  Bonesteel asked Aish to return to  give him the (BPT). Bonesteel knowing that the device saves the most recent test took a look at the BPT and  discovered that the officer actually blew a.097 exceeding the legal limit to drive and not what Aish had reported  to both him and to the Captain.  The department took action based on this dishonesty and gave Aish a 13 day  7    suspension. However, no determination was made that Aish’s dishonesty warranted the designation of Brady  impaired.    The Brady impairment designation came about in 2017 when a Public Defender, responding to concerns  expressed by his client, regarding the treatment he received form Mr. Aish when he was arrested prompted the  Public Defender to request a look at Mr. Aish’s Disciplinary file. It was the Public Defender, upon discovering  the 2006 incident of dishonesty, sought to have a Brady impairment designation applied to Mr. Aish.  The  Anoka County Attorney reviewed the claim and determined that Aish was indeed Brady impaired as a result of  the 2006 infraction.    The city was at that point of trying to determine if Mr. Aish could still effectively continue with the Columbia  Heights police force or would this impairment make him effectively useless when testifying for the prosecution.  The City decided not to terminate Mr. Aish but rather imposed a specific order directing his performance going  forward. On May 31, 2017 the city imposed upon Mr. Aish the following order:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.      It was this order, going forward, that would govern how Officer Aish would go about performing his  work as a Columbia Heights Police Officer and it was the Cities determination that Aish’s lack of  compliance with this order that led in large part  to the City’s decision to terminate Officer Aish.  As a result of the concerns raised by Aish’s reporting of this incident the department conducted an audit  of Aish’s reporting for the months leading up to this event and determined that there had been two  additional reporting inconsistencies by Aish in violation of Columbia Heights policies.  Both involved  8    domestic situations, one on September 5, 2019 and once on September 9, 2019, in which the city claims,  per policy, written reports were required for but Aish only documented the situations with notes entered  into the CAD.    On July 12, of 2017, less than 2 months from the date this order was imposed, the grievant received a  written warning, in part, for failing to comply with the May 31, 2017 written order relating to activating  body-worn camera.  This event involved a domestic dispute in which Mr. Aish either failed to activate the  camera when gathering information from a domestic abuse complainant or failed to properly label his  body-worn camera video evidence so it would be properly retained and could be used by the prosecution  at a later date. The written reprimand imposed also included a warning to Aish that “Further violations of  these or other policies could lead to more severe discipline including written reprimand, suspension or  termination.”    RELEVANT POLICIES  101:13 Knowledge Policies, Procedures, Statutes and Ordinances  Whether on duty or off duty, all employees shall establish and maintain a working knowledge of  departmental and divisional policies and procedures, and the relevant statutes and ordinances where  applicable.

At the conclusion of any pursuit initiated or participated in, the primary officer in the pursuit - or  if the primary officer is unable to complete the report, the supervisor or senior officer on duty - must  complete a report. This information may be incorporated into any other report prepared by the primary  officer the report shall minimally include:     1.    The reason for the pursuit, including specifically what information the officer knew at the  time the pursuit began.   2.  The route of the pursuit as best can be recalled     3.  Traffic conditions, presence and location of citizens.   4.  Any violations the driver of the fleeing vehicle committed during the pursuit.   5.   Other Columbia Heights squads involved and any other agencies.   6.  Damage to any vehicle, property, and/or injury to any person.   7.  Supervisor on duty at time of the pursuit.   8.   Road and weather conditions.   9.  Time pursuit began and ended.   10.  How, where, and why the pursuit concluded or was abandoned.   11.   Charges filed, if any.     B.  The primary officer must also complete the Minnesota Pursuit Reporting Form as required by  Statute §626.5531. If the primary officer is unable to complete this form, the form shall be filled out by the  supervisor or senior officer on duty.     C.   The Pursuit will be reviewed and critiqued by a Captain, and will include the supervisor, and  officers involved as soon after the incident as possible. The Captain will submit a summary of the critique  and applicable reports will be forwarded to the Chief of Police. The critique will be done and applicable  reports submitted for administrative uses, identification of training needs, and/or policy modification.     EMPLOYER’S ARGUMENT  11    The grievant has a history of deceptive and untruthful behavior that has clearly been documented in the  past and was clearly evident in the events leading to this termination.  The evidence identifying the  grievant’s untruthfulness in this case cannot be refuted as it was collected from unbiased officer worn- body cameras, Squad car videos, and computer generated data from squad on board computers. This  information is reinforced by direct testimony of witnesses and indisputable common sense. The grievant’s  past dishonesty requires no more evidence than the unequivocal fact that he was determined to be Brady  Impaired by the Anoka County Attorney’s office in 2017.  The designation of Brady Impairment is  applied when a police officer has been proven to have engaged in acts of dishonesty and thus their status  of Brady impaired must be identified to criminal defense attorneys  enabling an attack on the credibility  of that officers testimony.     Officer Aish was disciplined in 2006, receiving a 13 day suspension, for lying to both his supervisor and  to the Captain of the Columbia Heights Police Department regarding a breathalyzer test he performed on  a fellow officer from the Minneapolis Police Department. He was told not to return a confiscated service  revolver to that officer if the officer failed the breathalyzer test. Aish reported back to his supervisor that  the officer was .04 and reported to the Captain that he was .06 but in actuality the test results were a .097  which clearly would not warrant return of the revolver. The PBT (Portable Breathalyzer Test) stored the  most recent test conducted and it was from that that Aish was caught being untruthful to his superiors.    The Brady label was not applied in 2006 however, but rather came about serendipitously when a public  defender requested Aish’s disciplinary file in response to concerns that defense had regarding the way  Aish had treated their client. It was that inquiry that the brought Aish’s 2006 discipline into focus and  resulted in the Anoka County Attorney’s determination that Aish was Brady impaired.   The Columbia Heights Police Department at that point had to determine what the impact would be on the  department as a result of this Brady determination and could Aish continue to work for the department.   12    The City decided not to terminate Aish, but rather attempted to deal with the very serious credibility issue  Aish now presented by imposing the following order:   Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.    The department viewed this order as critical for Aish’s continued employment and that this order was in  effect a “Last Chance Agreement” for Mr. Aish.     Aish’s clear violation of this order and his dishonesty was readily evidenced through an investigation that  included a review of Aish’s body-worn camera, Fridley officer’s body camera, Fridley squad cameras, on  board computers, and dispatch recordings. This data revealed that Mr. Aish, turned off his body camera  while continuing to discuss the pursuit with Fridley officers and in three different places in his subsequent  reporting of the event revealed that he intentionally misrepresented the facts of the pursuit in an effort to  diminish the severity of the event and his involvement. The reason he did this was to justify reporting it as  an “Assist to another police department” rather than properly reporting the events as a pursuit which it  certainly was under Columbia Heights policy and state law.  By minimizing the event and documenting it  as an “Assist to another Department” it would severely diminish the scrutiny the report would be subject  to by leadership in the Columbia Height Police Department.   Following are three excerpts taken from Aish’s report which are irrefutable misrepresentations of the  actual facts:   1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to accelerate  again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several blocks now, I had  been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to continue and pulled over and  13    let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to accelerate northbound on Main  Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the suspect blow through the stop sign and  intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop (Emphasis added).    The camera squad video from Fridley officer Bulman’s car clearly shows that Aish did not pull over prior to the  suspect blowing through the stop sign at 57th Ave. rather the video is clear that Aish follows suspect right  through the stop sign and then verbalizes that suspect is picking up speed and then acknowledges that this is  going to be a pursuit and I am getting out.     The second misrepresentation in the report is his incorrect documenting of his speed. Stating:  2) “I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over  and stop. I followed at the posted speed limit.” (Emphasis added)    Once again this is not true.  The Fridley squad cars are equipped with a computer GPS system that tracks the  speed of the vehicle and is shown contemporaneously with the squad video which clearly reveals that Bulman’s  vehicle was reaching speeds of 58 miles per hour nearly two time the posted speed limit leading up to the PIT  maneuver.   At the same time the Elasky rear squad video also shows Aish trailing the two Fridley vehicles but  maintaining the same distance behind indicating that his vehicle would have to be traveling at the roughly the  same speed. Finally, the squad video at the scene of the PIT maneuver shows Aish arriving within just a couple  of seconds after Bulman’s car arrives confirming that Aish would have necessarily been traveling at up to 58  miles per hour in order to arrive immediately after the Fridley squads.    Aish does not contradict this undeniable video evidence rather concludes that he was mistaken.  He said he was  so focused on the work at hand that he did not look down to track his speed and it just felt like they were  moving at a slow pace. Frist, officers are trained to keep tract of this type of information and an officer of 20  years should certainly be able to track his speed in this situation.  In fact if, as he claimed, this was a very slow  following there was nothing that should have been that adrenalin producing that should have so effected his  ability to recognize or tract the speed at which he was traveling.  In addition, if he was not sure of his speed he  should not be claiming he was traveling at the posted speed limit he should have explained that he was not sure.  14    In addition Aish testified that he was not sure exactly what the speed limit was on the streets he was traveling.   Also, his claim defies common sense.  We all have driven automobiles and we all can tell when we are traveling  at a high rate of speed. Without tracking his speed he should certainly have known he was not moving at the  posted speed. His claim does not seem like a mistake rather an intentional misrepresentation.    The third misrepresentation in his report is that he stated:  3) I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.   The Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and  Trinity. I activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody  (Emphasis added).    Once again the misrepresentation of the timing of Aish activating his emergency lights is also captured  on Fridley squad video.  While Aish claimed he did not activate his emergency lights until he arrived at  the scene, after the PIT was completed, the Fridley squad rear camera video irrefutably proves  otherwise.  Rear camera video from Elasky’s squad shows that after the Fridley squads passed Aish’s  squad which had been pulled over to the curb Aish then pulls away from the curb immediately after the  Fridley squads pass him.  The video also clearly shows that Aish activates his emergency lights shortly  after pulling out which was well before the PIT occurred as documented by Aish.    All three of these misrepresentations tend to downplay the seriousness of the event, the role in which  Aish played in this process and the likelihood his portrayal of the facts would lead anyone to believe  that he had been involved in a pursuit.  Aish does not document the event as a pursuit and rather drafts a  report labeling it as an “Assist” to another department to ensure the lower level of scrutiny by his  supervisors.  Originally, Aish’s plan would have worked for him and the report would have gone  unchallenged had it not been for the purely coincidental encounter between Chief Lenny Austin had  with Fridley Police Sargent Titus when the two bumped into each other at the Columbia Heights police  department in which Titus explained that he was seeking documentation of a pursuit. Austin found it  troubling to hear that there was a Pursuit involving his department and he had not been made aware of  15    the “Pursuit.”  It was only a result of this chance encounter that prompted the ensuing investigation of  Aish leading ultimately his termination.      The Columbia Heights policies very clearly defines “Pursuit”  Columbia Heights policy  603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.   All of the elements of the policy have been met under the facts laid out. The Union however claimed that  these facts failed to establish a pursuit. The union argues first that this was merely a failure to stop not a  felony fleeing as the suspect never acknowledged or made any gesture indicating he was aware of Aish’s  presence. Without such awareness by the suspect the Union concludes that this was not fleeing thus there  was no violation of law as required by the policy. Neither under the policy nor under state law is there any  requirement that the suspect make some gesture to indicate they know they are being followed.   The state law defines fleeing as follows:   “To increase speed, extinguish motor vehicle headlights or taillights, refuse to stop the  vehicle, or use other means with intent to attempt to elude a peace officer following a  signal given by the peace officer to the driver of a motor vehicle.”    Contrary to the Union’s claim, each element of the State’s definition of “Pursuit” has been met as well as  meeting all the requirements the City’s Pursuit policy. While the objective evidence presented at the hearing  clearly shows that a pursuit occurred it is equally clear that Aish’s misrepresentations in his report  intentionally attempts to blur the fact that there was a fleeing.  An element of fleeing is that the driver  “Increases speed” thus Aish misrepresented that he was traveling at the speed limit.  Fleeing also requires  an evasive maneuver by the suspect thus Aish documents that he pulled out of the pursuit before the driver  ran through the stop sign at 57th Ave. thus before the evasive maneuver occurred and that also was not true.  In addition, he failed to document that he was traveling at nearly 2 times the speed limit which is also an  16    evasive maneuver.  Finally he said he did not turn on his emergency lights until he arrived at the scene of  the PIT once the suspect was apprehended. Also not true.  He turned on his lights and kept them on the  entire time he followed the Fridley officers pursuing suspect.  His failure to document accurately as to when  he activated his lights is another dishonest attempt to avoid any conclusion that Aish’s actions met the  Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy which requires activating emergency lights.   While the Union claims the “Violation of the law” requirement in the Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy  is a requirement to have a fleeing as defined by state law there is no such reference to a fleeing requirement  in the policy. The policy merely requires “Failure to stop as required by law” Minnesota law requires that  vehicles pull over and stop on the side of the road when approached by a police vehicle with its lights and  siren are activated. Minn. Stat. §§ 169.20, subd. 5; 169.011. The suspect did not do this thus his actions are  a pursuit under the Columbia Heights policy, regardless of whether there was a fleeing and thus should  have been reported as a pursuit.    The Pursuit reporting requirement of Columbia Heights policy 603:06 (See below) was also clearly violated  when Aish failed to document the Pursuit according to the policy.  Not only do his actions violate Columbia  Heights policy they also violate Minnesota Statute §626.5531 as all pursuits must be documented with the  state.    Columbia Heights Policy 603:06 Reporting and Review   At the conclusion of any pursuit initiated or participated in, the primary officer in the pursuit  - or if the primary officer is unable to complete the report, the supervisor or senior officer on  duty - must complete a report. This information may be incorporated into any other report  prepared by the primary officer the report shall minimally include: (Emphasis added)  1.    The reason for the pursuit, including specifically what information the officer knew at  the time the pursuit began.   2.  The route of the pursuit as best can be recalled   3.  Traffic conditions, presence and location of citizens.   17    4.  Any violations the driver of the fleeing vehicle committed during the pursuit.   5.   Other Columbia Heights squads involved and any other agencies.   6.  Damage to any vehicle, property, and/or injury to any person.   7.  Supervisor on duty at time of the pursuit.   8.   Road and weather conditions.   9.  Time pursuit began and ended.   10.  How, where, and why the pursuit concluded or was abandoned.   11.   Charges filed, if any.     B.  The primary officer must also complete the Minnesota Pursuit Reporting Form as  required by Statute §626.5531. If the primary officer is unable to complete this form, the form  shall be filled out by the supervisor or senior officer on duty.     C.   The Pursuit will be reviewed and critiqued by a Captain, and will include the  supervisor, and officers involved as soon after the incident as possible. The Captain will submit  a summary of the critique and applicable reports will be forwarded to the Chief of Police. The  critique will be done and applicable reports submitted for administrative uses, identification  of training needs, and/or policy modification.       Aish’s actions were clearly insubordination as he violated a direct order regarding body-worn camera  and phone call recordings. The order states:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  A clear violation of this direct order is easily seen when reviewing Aish’s body-worn camera which  shows Aish turning off his camera once the suspect is apprehended. Other officers at the scene clearly  continue to run their cameras and in fact Aish asks in a low voice to Officer Elasky “Are you on?”   Elasky says “Yes” and apologizes. Further he explains that he has to keep his on. Even with all this  Aish does not activate his camera while continuing to debrief about the event.  A second violation of  18    this order occurs a few hours later as Aish phones Fridley Officer Fetrow, without recording it, and  once again discusses the Pursuit and apologizes for his needing to get out of the pursuit.     In 2017 Aish believed he was going to be terminated as a result of his Brady impairment.  The  Department decided not to terminate but imposed this very clear and very strict order to record outside  interactions.  It was understood that this was a last chance for Aish to keep his job.  Failing to comply,  as indicted in the order, could cause his termination.  He understood that he could be fired for non- compliance but that did not stop him. Aish claims that former Chief Nadeau, prior to retiring, had soften  the adherence to the policy recognizing that under certain situations the recording was not required  when interacting with other departments.  The Union however chose not have Nadeau testify to such  modifications and no written modifications of the order were presented at the hearing.  Beyond that,  here was a situation in which there was a high speed pursuit of a reckless driver in a residential area.   Apprehension of the suspect followed a risky PIT maneuver which was followed by all officers at the  scene, including Aish, pulled out their guns and forcefully removed the suspect from his car.  Under no  circumstances would this have ever led anyone to the conclusion that any follow up debriefing between  the two police departments was the type of interaction that would not need to be captured by Aish under  his 2017 order.     UNION’S ARGUMENT  The employer fails all sense of objectivity when analyzing the facts of this case and only interprets  them only through a lens of a strong predisposition to view the grievant, Mathew Aish, as dishonest  causing the employer to view as a lie any honest explainable mistakes.  Clear evidence of the  employer’s effort to judge all the actions associated with this event in a light most unfavorable to Aish  the employer, without seeking any clarification or confirmation from Officer Elasky, jumped to the  conclusion that when Elasky touched his body-worn camera at the time Aish asked if he were “On” the  employer wrongly concluded that Elasky was book marking this point on his video as it was a  19    suspicious question to be asked. The truth of this action was revealed through Elasky’s testimony at the  hearing revealing that it was an innocent reflex action Elasky had developed regarding his body-worn  camera and in no way was evidence of his concern and his need to bookmark.  Quite the opposite was  the testimony of both Fetrow and Elasky in that they both explained that it is quite common for officers  to ask if another is “On” but not for nefarious reasons but rather to know so they can prevent expressing  themselves in a way they would rather not have captured on video.    Mathew Aish was a police officer in the Columbia Heights police department for over 20 years.  In  2006 he was disciplined for his dishonesty and has learned the hard way from his mistake. Since that  day Aish has never shied away from letting others, especially new officers, hear about his troubles in an  effort to help them learn from his mistake as he has.     This was not a pursuit under the Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy and there was no fleeing with  respect to Officer Aish under the state law.  The employer insists on an interpretation of “fleeing” and “pursuit” that defies logic. The employer  maintains a position as to what is a pursuit that runs completely contrary to the opinions of their  officers, Fridley officers, as well as the opinion of a recognized expert Peter Dahl.   Further, the employer fails to accept the logical interpretation of the facts surrounding the events on  October 27, 2019 and rather insists on labeling these as acts of dishonesty worthy of termination.  The  employer takes this unrelenting position even in light of the expert testimony of Peter Dahl who  provided a reasonable and logical explanation for Aish’s documentation of the events of October 27,  2019 that does not include any acts of dishonesty on Aish’s part. Mr. Dahl is currently an adjunct  instructor at Dakota County Technical College teaching Law Enforcement Customized Training,  including basic and advanced law enforcement including driving involving pursuit and related issues.    Columbia Heights pursuit policy reads as follows:   20    603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Expert witness Dahl carefully reviewed all the evidence including squad video and provided an expert opinion  that within a reasonable degree of police certainty Aish had not participated in a pursuit. Under the policy there  are three required elements.  1) Attempt to stop the vehicle  2) Police squad lights and siren must be on   3) Vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Dahl testified that the third element, fails to stop as required by law, was not met under these facts.  Dahl  testified that “Under the Law” is clearly a reference to the state law relating to fleeing, Fleeing therefore  requires an attempt by the suspect to “Elude a peace officer” and that was not present.  Aish speeding up to get  in position to follow the suspect is not a pursuit as was confirmed by the testimony of Fridley Officer Fetrow.   A pursuit requires an attempt to elude the officer and that did not occur.  The suspect never acknowledged the  officers presence as per the testimony of Aish who said the driver never looked in rear mirror or in any other  way gave any indication that he knew he was being followed.  He was never focused on the police car behind  him.  Fridley Officers Fetrow and Elasky confirmed this saying they could see the driver’s face as he passed  them on Main Street and testified that he had a “Fixed 1000-yard stare” indicating he in no way was aware of  the police car behind him. Consequently, from the time Aish got behind the suspect there were no eluding  maneuvers or even increased speed to suggest the driver was aware of the police officer much less trying to  elude the peace officer.  Once it appeared as though the suspect became aware of Aish. Officer Aish bowed out  of the process acknowledging the situation stating to dispatch “This is going to be a pursuit, I am getting out.”  Up until this point there was no fleeing therefore no “Violation of the law” thus the elements of Columbia  Heights pursuit policy had not been met according to the expert testimony of Peter Dahl. Dahl continues by  refuting the interpretation provided by the City in which the City claims that it is a violation of the law if a  driver does not pull over for an emergency vehicle.  Dahl explains that the law referenced by the employer was\n"

      "Too_Long1    Arbitration   LELS (Mathew Aish)/Columbia Heights Police Department    Grievance Arbitration Between:        BMS Case No.: 20 PA-1575    Columbia Heights Police Dept. (Employer)   and   Law Enforcement Labor Services Inc. (LELS)  Mathew Aish (Grievant)     REPRESENTATION  Representing Columbia Heights Police Department  Joan Quade, Attorney   BARNA, GUZY & STEFFEN, LTD.    Representing Mathew Aish:  Renee Zachman, Attorney  Mark Schneider, Attorney  Law Enforcement Labor Services  ISSUE  Did the employer have Just Cause to Terminate Mathew Aish?  If not, what is the appropriate Remedy?    INTRODUCTION  Mathew Aish was a police officer in Columbia Heights hired in 1999 and terminated on January 15, 2020.  Law  Enforcement Labor Services responded to the termination by filing a step one grievance on January 27, 2020.  The termination stems primarily from an incident that occurred on October 27, 2019 in which the grievant,  Mathew Aish, responded to a dispatch call regarding a driver operating a vehicle recklessly on city streets in  2    Columbia Heights and Fridley. The description relayed by dispatch was that of a white Taurus driving at speeds  up to 80 miles per hour and traveling north in south bound lanes of traffic.   The concerns raised by the City leading to their decision to terminate revolve around the follow up reporting of  this incident by Mathew Aish including concerns of truthfulness, accuracy and complying with a direct order to  activate body worn camera at all times when engaging with non-departmental personnel. This direct order came  about as a result of a 2006 incident in which Mr. Aish had falsely represented the sobriety test of another police  officer from a neighboring jurisdiction.  Due to the dishonesty involved in that event Mr. Aish was determined,  by the Anoka County Attorney’s Office, to be Brady impaired. As result of this designation the City is  compelled to reveal the issues of Aish’s dishonesty to defense council when Mr. Aish is involved in the  prosecution of a crime.  As a result of the 2006 incident the City imposed a requirement that Mr. Aish activate  his body worn camera whenever interacting with non-departmental personnel in an effort to diminish credibility  questions that would likely arise at subsequent criminal proceedings that involved Mr. Aish testifying on behalf  of the City and to create a process that would enable the City to keep Mr. Aish employed.    An Arbitration hearing was held at the Columbia Heights Police Department offices on August 17 to 19, 2020.    FACTS  Mathew Aish was terminated on January 15, 2020 after 20 plus years of services as a police officer for the city  of Columbia Heights. The incident that is largely the basis for this termination occurred at approximately 2:30  PM that afternoon in which a Columbia Heights Dispatcher announced that there was a driver proceeding  recklessly on the streets of Columbia Heights. Two Columbia Heights police officers, Officer Joseph Pikala and  Officer Mathew Aish, responded separately to the radio call. Due to the positioning of their squads it was Aish  who was able first to get eyes on the reckless driver and position his squad behind the driver.  Aish provided the  radio contact after beginning to trail the reckless driver.  He explained that he was traveling north on Main street  crossing highway 694.  This triggered the movement and positioning of two Fridley squads, one driven by  3    Officer Elasky and the other driven by an officer in training, Officer Bulman accompanied in his squad by  Officer Fetrow. Both Fridley squads were positioned on Main Street facing south and waited as Aish following  the suspect drove by them northbound. Once the reckless driver reached the two Fridley squads the Fridley  officers turned on sirens, pulled a U turn and got in behind Aish. Almost immediately after the Fridley Squads  completed their U turns the reckless driver ran a stop sign and Aish followed right behind through that stop  sign.  Aish announced that the driver was speeding up and said “This is going to be a pursuit and I am getting  out.”  At that time Aish pulled over to the curb and the Two Fridley officers fell in behind the reckless driver.   Video footage from the rear of Officer Elasky’s car showed that once the Fridley squads passed Aish he pulled  back out into traffic and began to follow behind the Fridley squads.  It was clear in the rear camera video that  once back in the traffic Aish turned his light back on and began to follow.  GPS systems installed on the Fridley  squads also recorded the speed the cars were traveling indicating that they were moving as fast as 58 mph.  The  front view camera on Bulman’s car also clearly shows the reckless driver turning left and running an additional  stop sign and then turning right onto a residential street.  It was at this time Fridley officers talked about  conducting a PIT maneuver on the reckless driver.  Bulman who was first behind the reckless driver was unable  to do the PIT as Bulman was a trainee and not qualified to initiate a PIT. Elasky said he would PIT and  proceeded to pass Bulman and performed the PIT disabling the White Taurus. Immediately behind Elasky were  Bulman and Fetrow in a Fridley squad and right behind them, just seconds behind Elasky was Aish. All the  officers, including Aish, ran up to the disabled car with guns drawn.  Fetrow can be heard clearly screaming get  your hands up. The driver was immediately pulled from his car and apprehended.    Once the driver was cuffed he was immediately was put in a Fridley squad car. At this point body cameras  caught the debriefing that occurred amongst the officers.  It is clear that shortly after the offender is place in the  Fridley squad Aish turns off his body camera.  Elasky continues to run his body camera and it is clear on his  camera that Aish asks in a quiet tone, “Are you on?” referring to body camera.  Elasky say “yes” and apologizes  and explains that he has to stay on.   4    A few hours later Aish submits an incident report of the event referring the action as “Reckless driver  complaint/ assist to Fridley PD”. The report does not refer to the action as a pursuit and thus not prompting the  required state documentation of a pursuit. The city takes issue with charactorizing this as an assist to another  department and concludes that under Columbia Heights policy as well as State law this should have been filed  as a Pursuit report and a state report submitted.  Statements within the report that the City takes issue with are as  follows:  1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to  accelerate again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several  blocks now, I had been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to  continue and pulled over and let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to  accelerate northbound on Main Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the  suspect blow through the stop sign and intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop  (Emphasis added)  2) I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over and  stop. I followed at the posted speed limit (Emphasis Added).  3)  I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.  The  Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and Trinity. I  activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody (Emphasis added).  The City claims each of the above identified statements in the report are false and intentionally written that way  to minimize Aish’s involvement in the event and thus making the event not appear as though it was a pursuit. If  not a determined to be a pursuit then less reporting required and therefore no issue for failure to properly  document. The video footage from Fridley squads confirms the inaccuracies in Aish’s report.  Fridley squad  footage and corresponding sound recording clearly shows Aish following suspect blowing through the stop sign  at 57th Ave and stating suspect is accelerating and then stating he is pulling out.  Secondly, the reports states he  was following at the posted speed. The Fridley squad GPS computers record the vehicle speed. The computer  5    vehicle recorded speeds are contemporaneous with the video and show speeds of as much as 58 mph as the  Fridley squads pursued and at the same time also showed Aish following right behind.  In addition, the video  also shows Aish arriving within just a few seconds of the completed PIT once again indicating he would have  had to be moving as fast as the speeds of the recorded for the Fridley squads. Finally Aish reported that he did  not turn on his emergency lights until he was on Starlight Street and after the PIT was completed.  The rear  camera view from Office Elasky’s car shows he actually turned on his emergency lights shortly after the Fridley  squads passed him on Main Street and kept them on while following the Fridley squads.  In addition to vehicle video footage body camera footage was also presented at the hearing.  The body camera  footage from Officer Aish was turned on as Aish arrived at the scene where the suspect was apprehended.   Aish’s body camera remained on until the suspect was placed in the Fridley squad at which point he turned off  his camera.  Body camera video of Elasky remained on after Aish had turned his off.  It is clear in Elasky’s  video that Aish walks up to him and asks in a low voice if Elasky is “on” understood to mean is your body  camera on to which Elasky apologizes and says yes and indicates he is required to have it on. Elasky body  camera reveals that Aish did continue to have conversations with two Fridley officers about the events leading  to the PIT that this discussion was not recorded on Aish’s body-worn camera.  Evidence was also presented that  Aish had a follow up phone conversation with Officer Fetrow before the end of his shift that night, which was  not recorded.  The testimony of Aish indicated that he apologized about “dumping” the situation back to Fridley  but explained that he was feeling like there was a target on his back and he was not comfortable with his not  knowing the Fridley streets like the Fridley officers did.   Within an hour and a half of this incident the previously referenced report was written and submitted. The  report indicated it was an assist of another department never referring to the situation as a pursuit. This report  was later reviewed and approved by Columbia Heights Sargent Fischer in which he did not identify any issues  or concerns with the report.   The first identified concern regarding this incident came about by coincidence when Columbia Heights police  captain, Lenny Austin, ran into Sergeant Kevin Titus, of the Fridley police, who was at the Columbia Heights  6    police department looking for body camera footage of Aish as a follow up the to the report he was writing  regarding the pursuit on the 27th of October.  Austin was not aware of a pursuit that involved his department as  Aish’s report characterized the event as an assist to another police Department.  This sent up a red flag for  Austin and set the investigation in motion. Austin’s initial review of Aish’s report identified a peculiar set of  facts, Fridley reported the event as pursuit but Aish’s report indicated that he was following the suspect at the  pasted speed, it was this incongruous fact that raised a red flag. The ensuing investigation identified the  previously mentioned inconsistency in Aish’s report and several other concerns.   Aish has had a history involving serious issues with honesty to the point where the Anoka County Attorney has  deemed him to be Brady impaired. Brady impairment is a label placed on police officers that have had an  incident of dishonesty in their work history as a police officer.  If a police officer is classified as Brady impaired  the prosecution is required to reveal to the defense the honesty issues associated with the police officer which  can impact that officer’s credibility and thus their effectiveness as a witness if criminal prosecution. The  incident leading to Aish’s Brady impairment designation dates back to 2006 yet the designation as Brady  impaired was not imposed until 2017.   The 2006 incident involved a Minneapolis police officer who had been arrested the night before and had his  service revolver confiscated by the Columbia Heights police.  He returned to the Columbia Heights police  department the following morning to get his gun returned. He was acquainted with Officer Aish through their  Minneapolis Police Academy training course years earlier.  When he arrived to get his gun returned Corporal  Bonesteel informed Aish not to give the Minneapolis officer his revolver if he did not register a 0.0 on the  portable breath test. Aish went outside to administer the portable breath test (BPT) on the officer and then  reported back to Bonesteel that the officer was Ok to drive and that he had blown a .04. A few minutes later he  reported to Captain Lenny Austin that the Minneapolis officer blew a .06.  Bonesteel asked Aish to return to  give him the (BPT). Bonesteel knowing that the device saves the most recent test took a look at the BPT and  discovered that the officer actually blew a.097 exceeding the legal limit to drive and not what Aish had reported  to both him and to the Captain.  The department took action based on this dishonesty and gave Aish a 13 day  7    suspension. However, no determination was made that Aish’s dishonesty warranted the designation of Brady  impaired.    The Brady impairment designation came about in 2017 when a Public Defender, responding to concerns  expressed by his client, regarding the treatment he received form Mr. Aish when he was arrested prompted the  Public Defender to request a look at Mr. Aish’s Disciplinary file. It was the Public Defender, upon discovering  the 2006 incident of dishonesty, sought to have a Brady impairment designation applied to Mr. Aish.  The  Anoka County Attorney reviewed the claim and determined that Aish was indeed Brady impaired as a result of  the 2006 infraction.    The city was at that point of trying to determine if Mr. Aish could still effectively continue with the Columbia  Heights police force or would this impairment make him effectively useless when testifying for the prosecution.  The City decided not to terminate Mr. Aish but rather imposed a specific order directing his performance going  forward. On May 31, 2017 the city imposed upon Mr. Aish the following order:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.      It was this order, going forward, that would govern how Officer Aish would go about performing his  work as a Columbia Heights Police Officer and it was the Cities determination that Aish’s lack of  compliance with this order that led in large part  to the City’s decision to terminate Officer Aish.  As a result of the concerns raised by Aish’s reporting of this incident the department conducted an audit  of Aish’s reporting for the months leading up to this event and determined that there had been two  additional reporting inconsistencies by Aish in violation of Columbia Heights policies.  Both involved  8    domestic situations, one on September 5, 2019 and once on September 9, 2019, in which the city claims,  per policy, written reports were required for but Aish only documented the situations with notes entered  into the CAD.    On July 12, of 2017, less than 2 months from the date this order was imposed, the grievant received a  written warning, in part, for failing to comply with the May 31, 2017 written order relating to activating  body-worn camera.  This event involved a domestic dispute in which Mr. Aish either failed to activate the  camera when gathering information from a domestic abuse complainant or failed to properly label his  body-worn camera video evidence so it would be properly retained and could be used by the prosecution  at a later date. The written reprimand imposed also included a warning to Aish that “Further violations of  these or other policies could lead to more severe discipline including written reprimand, suspension or  termination.”    RELEVANT POLICIES  101:13 Knowledge Policies, Procedures, Statutes and Ordinances  Whether on duty or off duty, all employees shall establish and maintain a working knowledge of  departmental and divisional policies and procedures, and the relevant statutes and ordinances where  applicable.

EMPLOYER’S ARGUMENT  11    The grievant has a history of deceptive and untruthful behavior that has clearly been documented in the  past and was clearly evident in the events leading to this termination.  The evidence identifying the  grievant’s untruthfulness in this case cannot be refuted as it was collected from unbiased officer worn- body cameras, Squad car videos, and computer generated data from squad on board computers. This  information is reinforced by direct testimony of witnesses and indisputable common sense. The grievant’s  past dishonesty requires no more evidence than the unequivocal fact that he was determined to be Brady  Impaired by the Anoka County Attorney’s office in 2017.  The designation of Brady Impairment is  applied when a police officer has been proven to have engaged in acts of dishonesty and thus their status  of Brady impaired must be identified to criminal defense attorneys  enabling an attack on the credibility  of that officers testimony.     Officer Aish was disciplined in 2006, receiving a 13 day suspension, for lying to both his supervisor and  to the Captain of the Columbia Heights Police Department regarding a breathalyzer test he performed on  a fellow officer from the Minneapolis Police Department. He was told not to return a confiscated service  revolver to that officer if the officer failed the breathalyzer test. Aish reported back to his supervisor that  the officer was .04 and reported to the Captain that he was .06 but in actuality the test results were a .097  which clearly would not warrant return of the revolver. The PBT (Portable Breathalyzer Test) stored the  most recent test conducted and it was from that that Aish was caught being untruthful to his superiors.    The Brady label was not applied in 2006 however, but rather came about serendipitously when a public  defender requested Aish’s disciplinary file in response to concerns that defense had regarding the way  Aish had treated their client. It was that inquiry that the brought Aish’s 2006 discipline into focus and  resulted in the Anoka County Attorney’s determination that Aish was Brady impaired.   The Columbia Heights Police Department at that point had to determine what the impact would be on the  department as a result of this Brady determination and could Aish continue to work for the department.   12    The City decided not to terminate Aish, but rather attempted to deal with the very serious credibility issue  Aish now presented by imposing the following order:   Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.    The department viewed this order as critical for Aish’s continued employment and that this order was in  effect a “Last Chance Agreement” for Mr. Aish.     Aish’s clear violation of this order and his dishonesty was readily evidenced through an investigation that  included a review of Aish’s body-worn camera, Fridley officer’s body camera, Fridley squad cameras, on  board computers, and dispatch recordings. This data revealed that Mr. Aish, turned off his body camera  while continuing to discuss the pursuit with Fridley officers and in three different places in his subsequent  reporting of the event revealed that he intentionally misrepresented the facts of the pursuit in an effort to  diminish the severity of the event and his involvement. The reason he did this was to justify reporting it as  an “Assist to another police department” rather than properly reporting the events as a pursuit which it  certainly was under Columbia Heights policy and state law.  By minimizing the event and documenting it  as an “Assist to another Department” it would severely diminish the scrutiny the report would be subject  to by leadership in the Columbia Height Police Department.   Following are three excerpts taken from Aish’s report which are irrefutable misrepresentations of the  actual facts:   1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to accelerate  again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several blocks now, I had  been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to continue and pulled over and  13    let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to accelerate northbound on Main  Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the suspect blow through the stop sign and  intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop (Emphasis added).    The camera squad video from Fridley officer Bulman’s car clearly shows that Aish did not pull over prior to the  suspect blowing through the stop sign at 57th Ave. rather the video is clear that Aish follows suspect right  through the stop sign and then verbalizes that suspect is picking up speed and then acknowledges that this is  going to be a pursuit and I am getting out.     The second misrepresentation in the report is his incorrect documenting of his speed. Stating:  2) “I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over  and stop. I followed at the posted speed limit.” (Emphasis added)    Once again this is not true.  The Fridley squad cars are equipped with a computer GPS system that tracks the  speed of the vehicle and is shown contemporaneously with the squad video which clearly reveals that Bulman’s  vehicle was reaching speeds of 58 miles per hour nearly two time the posted speed limit leading up to the PIT  maneuver.   At the same time the Elasky rear squad video also shows Aish trailing the two Fridley vehicles but  maintaining the same distance behind indicating that his vehicle would have to be traveling at the roughly the  same speed. Finally, the squad video at the scene of the PIT maneuver shows Aish arriving within just a couple  of seconds after Bulman’s car arrives confirming that Aish would have necessarily been traveling at up to 58  miles per hour in order to arrive immediately after the Fridley squads.    Aish does not contradict this undeniable video evidence rather concludes that he was mistaken.  He said he was  so focused on the work at hand that he did not look down to track his speed and it just felt like they were  moving at a slow pace. Frist, officers are trained to keep tract of this type of information and an officer of 20  years should certainly be able to track his speed in this situation.  In fact if, as he claimed, this was a very slow  following there was nothing that should have been that adrenalin producing that should have so effected his  ability to recognize or tract the speed at which he was traveling.  In addition, if he was not sure of his speed he  should not be claiming he was traveling at the posted speed limit he should have explained that he was not sure.  14    In addition Aish testified that he was not sure exactly what the speed limit was on the streets he was traveling.   Also, his claim defies common sense.  We all have driven automobiles and we all can tell when we are traveling  at a high rate of speed. Without tracking his speed he should certainly have known he was not moving at the  posted speed. His claim does not seem like a mistake rather an intentional misrepresentation.    The third misrepresentation in his report is that he stated:  3) I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.   The Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and  Trinity. I activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody  (Emphasis added).    Once again the misrepresentation of the timing of Aish activating his emergency lights is also captured  on Fridley squad video.  While Aish claimed he did not activate his emergency lights until he arrived at  the scene, after the PIT was completed, the Fridley squad rear camera video irrefutably proves  otherwise.  Rear camera video from Elasky’s squad shows that after the Fridley squads passed Aish’s  squad which had been pulled over to the curb Aish then pulls away from the curb immediately after the  Fridley squads pass him.  The video also clearly shows that Aish activates his emergency lights shortly  after pulling out which was well before the PIT occurred as documented by Aish.    All three of these misrepresentations tend to downplay the seriousness of the event, the role in which  Aish played in this process and the likelihood his portrayal of the facts would lead anyone to believe  that he had been involved in a pursuit.  Aish does not document the event as a pursuit and rather drafts a  report labeling it as an “Assist” to another department to ensure the lower level of scrutiny by his  supervisors.  Originally, Aish’s plan would have worked for him and the report would have gone  unchallenged had it not been for the purely coincidental encounter between Chief Lenny Austin had  with Fridley Police Sargent Titus when the two bumped into each other at the Columbia Heights police  department in which Titus explained that he was seeking documentation of a pursuit. Austin found it  troubling to hear that there was a Pursuit involving his department and he had not been made aware of  15    the “Pursuit.”  It was only a result of this chance encounter that prompted the ensuing investigation of  Aish leading ultimately his termination.      The Columbia Heights policies very clearly defines “Pursuit”  Columbia Heights policy  603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.   All of the elements of the policy have been met under the facts laid out. The Union however claimed that  these facts failed to establish a pursuit. The union argues first that this was merely a failure to stop not a  felony fleeing as the suspect never acknowledged or made any gesture indicating he was aware of Aish’s  presence. Without such awareness by the suspect the Union concludes that this was not fleeing thus there  was no violation of law as required by the policy. Neither under the policy nor under state law is there any  requirement that the suspect make some gesture to indicate they know they are being followed.   The state law defines fleeing as follows:   “To increase speed, extinguish motor vehicle headlights or taillights, refuse to stop the  vehicle, or use other means with intent to attempt to elude a peace officer following a  signal given by the peace officer to the driver of a motor vehicle.”    Contrary to the Union’s claim, each element of the State’s definition of “Pursuit” has been met as well as  meeting all the requirements the City’s Pursuit policy. While the objective evidence presented at the hearing  clearly shows that a pursuit occurred it is equally clear that Aish’s misrepresentations in his report  intentionally attempts to blur the fact that there was a fleeing.  An element of fleeing is that the driver  “Increases speed” thus Aish misrepresented that he was traveling at the speed limit.  Fleeing also requires  an evasive maneuver by the suspect thus Aish documents that he pulled out of the pursuit before the driver  ran through the stop sign at 57th Ave. thus before the evasive maneuver occurred and that also was not true.  In addition, he failed to document that he was traveling at nearly 2 times the speed limit which is also an  16    evasive maneuver.  Finally he said he did not turn on his emergency lights until he arrived at the scene of  the PIT once the suspect was apprehended. Also not true.  He turned on his lights and kept them on the  entire time he followed the Fridley officers pursuing suspect.  His failure to document accurately as to when  he activated his lights is another dishonest attempt to avoid any conclusion that Aish’s actions met the  Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy which requires activating emergency lights.   While the Union claims the “Violation of the law” requirement in the Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy  is a requirement to have a fleeing as defined by state law there is no such reference to a fleeing requirement  in the policy. The policy merely requires “Failure to stop as required by law” Minnesota law requires that  vehicles pull over and stop on the side of the road when approached by a police vehicle with its lights and  siren are activated. Minn. Stat. §§ 169.20, subd. 5; 169.011. The suspect did not do this thus his actions are  a pursuit under the Columbia Heights policy, regardless of whether there was a fleeing and thus should  have been reported as a pursuit.    The Pursuit reporting requirement of Columbia Heights policy 603:06 (See below) was also clearly violated  when Aish failed to document the Pursuit according to the policy.  Not only do his actions violate Columbia  Heights policy they also violate Minnesota Statute §626.5531 as all pursuits must be documented with the  state.    Columbia Heights Policy 603:06 Reporting and Review   At the conclusion of any pursuit initiated or participated in, the primary officer in the pursuit  - or if the primary officer is unable to complete the report, the supervisor or senior officer on  duty - must complete a report. This information may be incorporated into any other report  prepared by the primary officer the report shall minimally include: (Emphasis added)  1.    The reason for the pursuit, including specifically what information the officer knew at  the time the pursuit began.   2.  The route of the pursuit as best can be recalled   3.  Traffic conditions, presence and location of citizens.   17    4.  Any violations the driver of the fleeing vehicle committed during the pursuit.   5.   Other Columbia Heights squads involved and any other agencies.   6.  Damage to any vehicle, property, and/or injury to any person.   7.  Supervisor on duty at time of the pursuit.   8.   Road and weather conditions.   9.  Time pursuit began and ended.   10.  How, where, and why the pursuit concluded or was abandoned.   11.   Charges filed, if any.     B.  The primary officer must also complete the Minnesota Pursuit Reporting Form as  required by Statute §626.5531. If the primary officer is unable to complete this form, the form  shall be filled out by the supervisor or senior officer on duty.     C.   The Pursuit will be reviewed and critiqued by a Captain, and will include the  supervisor, and officers involved as soon after the incident as possible. The Captain will submit  a summary of the critique and applicable reports will be forwarded to the Chief of Police. The  critique will be done and applicable reports submitted for administrative uses, identification  of training needs, and/or policy modification.       Aish’s actions were clearly insubordination as he violated a direct order regarding body-worn camera  and phone call recordings. The order states:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  A clear violation of this direct order is easily seen when reviewing Aish’s body-worn camera which  shows Aish turning off his camera once the suspect is apprehended. Other officers at the scene clearly  continue to run their cameras and in fact Aish asks in a low voice to Officer Elasky “Are you on?”   Elasky says “Yes” and apologizes. Further he explains that he has to keep his on. Even with all this  Aish does not activate his camera while continuing to debrief about the event.  A second violation of  18    this order occurs a few hours later as Aish phones Fridley Officer Fetrow, without recording it, and  once again discusses the Pursuit and apologizes for his needing to get out of the pursuit.     In 2017 Aish believed he was going to be terminated as a result of his Brady impairment.  The  Department decided not to terminate but imposed this very clear and very strict order to record outside  interactions.  It was understood that this was a last chance for Aish to keep his job.  Failing to comply,  as indicted in the order, could cause his termination.  He understood that he could be fired for non- compliance but that did not stop him. Aish claims that former Chief Nadeau, prior to retiring, had soften  the adherence to the policy recognizing that under certain situations the recording was not required  when interacting with other departments.  The Union however chose not have Nadeau testify to such  modifications and no written modifications of the order were presented at the hearing.  Beyond that,  here was a situation in which there was a high speed pursuit of a reckless driver in a residential area.   Apprehension of the suspect followed a risky PIT maneuver which was followed by all officers at the  scene, including Aish, pulled out their guns and forcefully removed the suspect from his car.  Under no  circumstances would this have ever led anyone to the conclusion that any follow up debriefing between  the two police departments was the type of interaction that would not need to be captured by Aish under  his 2017 order.     UNION’S ARGUMENT  The employer fails all sense of objectivity when analyzing the facts of this case and only interprets  them only through a lens of a strong predisposition to view the grievant, Mathew Aish, as dishonest  causing the employer to view as a lie any honest explainable mistakes.  Clear evidence of the  employer’s effort to judge all the actions associated with this event in a light most unfavorable to Aish  the employer, without seeking any clarification or confirmation from Officer Elasky, jumped to the  conclusion that when Elasky touched his body-worn camera at the time Aish asked if he were “On” the  employer wrongly concluded that Elasky was book marking this point on his video as it was a  19    suspicious question to be asked. The truth of this action was revealed through Elasky’s testimony at the  hearing revealing that it was an innocent reflex action Elasky had developed regarding his body-worn  camera and in no way was evidence of his concern and his need to bookmark.  Quite the opposite was  the testimony of both Fetrow and Elasky in that they both explained that it is quite common for officers  to ask if another is “On” but not for nefarious reasons but rather to know so they can prevent expressing  themselves in a way they would rather not have captured on video.    Mathew Aish was a police officer in the Columbia Heights police department for over 20 years.  In  2006 he was disciplined for his dishonesty and has learned the hard way from his mistake. Since that  day Aish has never shied away from letting others, especially new officers, hear about his troubles in an  effort to help them learn from his mistake as he has.     This was not a pursuit under the Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy and there was no fleeing with  respect to Officer Aish under the state law.  The employer insists on an interpretation of “fleeing” and “pursuit” that defies logic. The employer  maintains a position as to what is a pursuit that runs completely contrary to the opinions of their  officers, Fridley officers, as well as the opinion of a recognized expert Peter Dahl.   Further, the employer fails to accept the logical interpretation of the facts surrounding the events on  October 27, 2019 and rather insists on labeling these as acts of dishonesty worthy of termination.  The  employer takes this unrelenting position even in light of the expert testimony of Peter Dahl who  provided a reasonable and logical explanation for Aish’s documentation of the events of October 27,  2019 that does not include any acts of dishonesty on Aish’s part. Mr. Dahl is currently an adjunct  instructor at Dakota County Technical College teaching Law Enforcement Customized Training,  including basic and advanced law enforcement including driving involving pursuit and related issues.    Columbia Heights pursuit policy reads as follows:   20    603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Expert witness Dahl carefully reviewed all the evidence including squad video and provided an expert opinion  that within a reasonable degree of police certainty Aish had not participated in a pursuit. Under the policy there  are three required elements.  1) Attempt to stop the vehicle  2) Police squad lights and siren must be on   3) Vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Dahl testified that the third element, fails to stop as required by law, was not met under these facts.  Dahl  testified that “Under the Law” is clearly a reference to the state law relating to fleeing, Fleeing therefore  requires an attempt by the suspect to “Elude a peace officer” and that was not present.  Aish speeding up to get  in position to follow the suspect is not a pursuit as was confirmed by the testimony of Fridley Officer Fetrow.   A pursuit requires an attempt to elude the officer and that did not occur.  The suspect never acknowledged the  officers presence as per the testimony of Aish who said the driver never looked in rear mirror or in any other  way gave any indication that he knew he was being followed.  He was never focused on the police car behind  him.  Fridley Officers Fetrow and Elasky confirmed this saying they could see the driver’s face as he passed  them on Main Street and testified that he had a “Fixed 1000-yard stare” indicating he in no way was aware of  the police car behind him. Consequently, from the time Aish got behind the suspect there were no eluding  maneuvers or even increased speed to suggest the driver was aware of the police officer much less trying to  elude the peace officer.  Once it appeared as though the suspect became aware of Aish. Officer Aish bowed out  of the process acknowledging the situation stating to dispatch “This is going to be a pursuit, I am getting out.”  Up until this point there was no fleeing therefore no “Violation of the law” thus the elements of Columbia  Heights pursuit policy had not been met according to the expert testimony of Peter Dahl. Dahl continues by  refuting the interpretation provided by the City in which the City claims that it is a violation of the law if a  driver does not pull over for an emergency vehicle.  Dahl explains that the law referenced by the employer was\n"

       "'PRISONLEGALNEWS.ORG ›  Annotations   $\\u0cd4ೌ,ೌೌೌ Minnesota Illegal Search & Seizure Verdict Upheld; Attorney Fees Slashed \\u0cd1ೌ% MARK WILSON AUGUST ೄೄ, \\u0cc5ೃೄ\\u0cc9 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on G+ Share with email A Minnesota federal court upheld an \\uf653\\uf64b\\uf643,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643 jury verdict on illegal search and seizure claims. \\ue053e court reduced Plaintiﬀs\\' requested attorney\\'s fees by \\uf648\\uf643 percent, for a total fee award of \\uf653\\uf644\\uf645\\uf64b,\\uf647\\uf64c\\uf64c.\\uf64b\\uf648. Just before \\uf644 a.m., on January \\uf64b, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643, Champlin, Minnesota police responded to a veterinary hospital burglary. Police used a canine to track the suspect who ﬂed the crime scene. \\ue053e canine lost the scent but eventually led Sergeant Bill Schmidt and Oﬃcers Roxanne Aﬀeldt and Robert Topp, to the home of Ronald Rosen and June Trnka. Aﬀeldt knocked on the front door but received no response. Schmidt and Aﬀeldt then went to the rear of the home, entered an enclosed porch, and knocked on the interior house door. Receiving no response, the oﬃcers then searched through belongings on the porch and took Rosen\\'s shoes. \\ue053ey did not leave a receipt or any other indication that they had been there or seized property. \"\\ue053e same conduct by one not a police oﬃcer would be considered theft,\" the court observed. Police then obtained a search warrant for Rosen\\'s home, on the basis of their investigation and his shoes. \\ue053at warrant was not executed until fourteen ✕ days later, on January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643. Champlin police detained Rosen for more than an hour while his home was searched. Detective Brian Wentworth questioned Rosen and repeatedly threatened to arrest him or a member of his family. \\ue053e search ultimately did not reveal any evidence connected with the burglary. About two weeks later, Wentworth concluded after reviewing the reports and evidence that it was \"obvious\" that Rosen\\'s shoes did not match footprints at the scene and Rosen was not involved in the burglary. Wentworth returned his shoes and apologized. Rosen and Trnka brought suit in state court but Defendants removed to federal court. \\ue053e district court dismissed Plaintiﬀs\\' state law claims and Defendants Wentworth and Topp from the action. \\ue053e court held that it would instruct the jury that the warrantless entry into Plaintiﬀs\\' porch and search of their belongings violated the Fourth Amendment, as a matter of law. \\ue053e court also concluded that while the search warrant was lawfully issued, the jury could determine whether the January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 search and detainment was a product of the illegal search, and to what degree, if any, the search should aﬀect the damage award. At the close of Plaintiﬀs\\' case-in-chief, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a mistrial, challenging the court\\'s jury instruction. \\ue053e motion was denied. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Plaintiﬀs, awarding compensatory damages totaling \\uf653\\uf644\\uf643,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643. It also awarded punitive damages of \\uf653\\uf648\\uf648,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643 against Schmidt and \\uf653\\uf644\\uf648,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643 against Aﬀeldt. Following the verdict, Defendants renewed their motion for a directed verdict or new trial. Plaintiﬀs moved for an award of \\uf653\\uf645\\uf648\\uf648,\\uf64c\\uf645\\uf64c.\\uf643\\uf643 in attorney\\'s fees and \\uf653\\uf644,\\uf643\\uf64a\\uf643.\\uf649\\uf64c in costs, for a total award of \\uf653\\uf645\\uf648\\uf649,\\uf64c\\uf64c\\uf64c.\\uf649\\uf64c. \\ue053e court denied Defendants\\' motion, ﬁnding that the knock and talk exception to the Fourth Amendment \"does not apply to the facts in this case.\" \\ue053e court also rejected Defendants\\' argument that \"the jury should not have heard evidence regarding the search warrant application and the January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 search of Plaintiﬀs\\' home because these events were legal and irrelevant to the original search.\" \\ue053e court held that \"a reasonable jury could have still concluded that the search warrant application and the January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 search were the direct and probable consequences of the January \\uf64b, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 entry and search.\" \\ue053e court also rejected Defendants\\' challenge to the punitive damage instruction. \"Schmidt made a series of crude personal attacks on Rosen\\'s character, and suggested he intended to pursue Rosen out of anger or personal animosity. Plaintiﬀs also introduced evidence suggesting Defendants pursued their investigation of Rosen in deliberate ignorance of the facts,\" the court found. \"\\ue053is evidence could allow a reasonable factﬁnder to conclude Defendants recklessly disregarded Plaintiﬀs\\' constitutional rights. As a result, the question of punitive damages was properly put to the jury.\" \\ue053e court ﬁnally rejected Defendants\\' argument that a mistrial was warranted because during closing statements, Plaintiﬀs\\' counsel \"stated without elaboration that Defendants \\'don\\'t pay,\\'\" implying that they would not suﬀer personal ﬁnancial impact as a result of a verdict against them. Noting that defense counsel argued that \"Defendants should not be required to `ﬁnance\\' Plaintiﬀs\\' new American dream,\\'\" the court found \"these two statements are of comparably prejudicial eﬀect\" and \"the jury received an appropriate curative instruction.\" \\ue053e denial of a mistrial did not result in a \"miscarriage of justice.\" \\ue053e court then found that a reduction of Plaintiﬀs\\' attorney fee request was appropriate because \"counsel have \\'over-lawyered\\' or overbilled their work.\" Ultimately, the court found \"based on a careful review of the billing statements,\" that \"a reduction of \\uf648\\uf643\\uf642 reﬂects a fair billing for the work performed in this case.\" \\ue053at award \"still signiﬁcantly exceeds the amount of their clients\\' recover from a generous jury.\" See: Rosen v. Wentworth, \\uf644\\uf646 F.Supp\\uf646d \\uf64c\\uf647\\uf647 (D. Minn \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf647).

       "'PRISONLEGALNEWS.ORG ›  Annotations   $\\u0cd4ೌ,ೌೌೌ Minnesota Illegal Search & Seizure Verdict Upheld; Attorney Fees Slashed \\u0cd1ೌ% MARK WILSON AUGUST ೄೄ, \\u0cc5ೃೄ\\u0cc9 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on G+ Share with email A Minnesota federal court upheld an \\uf653\\uf64b\\uf643,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643 jury verdict on illegal search and seizure claims. \\ue053e court reduced Plaintiffs\\' requested attorney\\'s fees by \\uf648\\uf643 percent, for a total fee award of \\uf653\\uf644\\uf645\\uf64b,\\uf647\\uf64c\\uf64c.\\uf64b\\uf648. Just before \\uf644 a.m., on January \\uf64b, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643, Champlin, Minnesota police responded to a veterinary hospital burglary. Police used a canine to track the suspect who fled the crime scene. \\ue053e canine lost the scent but eventually led Sergeant Bill Schmidt and Officers Roxanne Affeldt and Robert Topp, to the home of Ronald Rosen and June Trnka. Affeldt knocked on the front door but received no response. Schmidt and Affeldt then went to the rear of the home, entered an enclosed porch, and knocked on the interior house door. Receiving no response, the officers then searched through belongings on the porch and took Rosen\\'s shoes. \\ue053ey did not leave a receipt or any other indication that they had been there or seized property. \"\\ue053e same conduct by one not a police officer would be considered theft,\" the court observed. Police then obtained a search warrant for Rosen\\'s home, on the basis of their investigation and his shoes. \\ue053at warrant was not executed until fourteen ✕ days later, on January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643. Champlin police detained Rosen for more than an hour while his home was searched. Detective Brian Wentworth questioned Rosen and repeatedly threatened to arrest him or a member of his family. \\ue053e search ultimately did not reveal any evidence connected with the burglary. About two weeks later, Wentworth concluded after reviewing the reports and evidence that it was \"obvious\" that Rosen\\'s shoes did not match footprints at the scene and Rosen was not involved in the burglary. Wentworth returned his shoes and apologized. Rosen and Trnka brought suit in state court but Defendants removed to federal court. \\ue053e district court dismissed Plaintiffs\\' state law claims and Defendants Wentworth and Topp from the action. \\ue053e court held that it would instruct the jury that the warrantless entry into Plaintiffs\\' porch and search of their belongings violated the Fourth Amendment, as a matter of law. \\ue053e court also concluded that while the search warrant was lawfully issued, the jury could determine whether the January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 search and detainment was a product of the illegal search, and to what degree, if any, the search should affect the damage award. At the close of Plaintiffs\\' case-in-chief, Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a mistrial, challenging the court\\'s jury instruction. \\ue053e motion was denied. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Plaintiffs, awarding compensatory damages totaling \\uf653\\uf644\\uf643,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643. It also awarded punitive damages of \\uf653\\uf648\\uf648,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643 against Schmidt and \\uf653\\uf644\\uf648,\\uf643\\uf643\\uf643 against Affeldt. Following the verdict, Defendants renewed their motion for a directed verdict or new trial. Plaintiffs moved for an award of \\uf653\\uf645\\uf648\\uf648,\\uf64c\\uf645\\uf64c.\\uf643\\uf643 in attorney\\'s fees and \\uf653\\uf644,\\uf643\\uf64a\\uf643.\\uf649\\uf64c in costs, for a total award of \\uf653\\uf645\\uf648\\uf649,\\uf64c\\uf64c\\uf64c.\\uf649\\uf64c. \\ue053e court denied Defendants\\' motion, finding that the knock and talk exception to the Fourth Amendment \"does not apply to the facts in this case.\" \\ue053e court also rejected Defendants\\' argument that \"the jury should not have heard evidence regarding the search warrant application and the January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 search of Plaintiffs\\' home because these events were legal and irrelevant to the original search.\" \\ue053e court held that \"a reasonable jury could have still concluded that the search warrant application and the January \\uf645\\uf645, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 search were the direct and probable consequences of the January \\uf64b, \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf643 entry and search.\" \\ue053e court also rejected Defendants\\' challenge to the punitive damage instruction. \"Schmidt made a series of crude personal attacks on Rosen\\'s character, and suggested he intended to pursue Rosen out of anger or personal animosity. Plaintiffs also introduced evidence suggesting Defendants pursued their investigation of Rosen in deliberate ignorance of the facts,\" the court found. \"\\ue053is evidence could allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude Defendants recklessly disregarded Plaintiffs\\' constitutional rights. As a result, the question of punitive damages was properly put to the jury.\" \\ue053e court finally rejected Defendants\\' argument that a mistrial was warranted because during closing statements, Plaintiffs\\' counsel \"stated without elaboration that Defendants \\'don\\'t pay,\\'\" implying that they would not suffer personal financial impact as a result of a verdict against them. Noting that defense counsel argued that \"Defendants should not be required to `finance\\' Plaintiffs\\' new American dream,\\'\" the court found \"these two statements are of comparably prejudicial effect\" and \"the jury received an appropriate curative instruction.\" \\ue053e denial of a mistrial did not result in a \"miscarriage of justice.\" \\ue053e court then found that a reduction of Plaintiffs\\' attorney fee request was appropriate because \"counsel have \\'over-lawyered\\' or overbilled their work.\" Ultimately, the court found \"based on a careful review of the billing statements,\" that \"a reduction of \\uf648\\uf643\\uf642 reflects a fair billing for the work performed in this case.\" \\ue053at award \"still significantly exceeds the amount of their clients\\' recover from a generous jury.\" See: Rosen v. Wentworth, \\uf644\\uf646 F.Supp\\uf646d \\uf64c\\uf647\\uf647 (D. Minn \\uf645\\uf643\\uf644\\uf647).

Learn more ORDER This matter is before the court on defendants' motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or in the alternative, for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.  Based on a review of the 7le, record, and for the following reasons, the court grants defendants' motions and plainti9's claims are dismissed. 1 1 Defendant Brad Wayne was dismissed from this matter at the hearing unopposed by plainti9. (See also Pl.'s Mem. at 30.) BACKGROUND On June 27, 1995, three-year old Jessica Swanson was reported missing to law enforcement authorities from her home in Goodhue County, Minnesota. In the four years that followed the disappearance of Jessica Swanson, Minnesota law enforcement agencies conducted an extensive investigation into her disappearance and were unable to resolve the circumstances surrounding her disappearance. During the period of 1995 through 1999, law enforcement agencies identi7ed the main suspect as Dale Jenson, the live-in boyfriend of Jessica Swanson's mother and the last person to see her. During the summer of 1999, the Goodhue County Attorney's o:ce and Goodhue County law enforcement agencies concluded that probable cause existed to charge Dale Jenson with the kidnaping of Jessica Swanson as well 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 3/18 as with the deprivation of parental and custodial rights. The mother of Jessica Swanson, Michelle Swanson, was to be charged with assisting Jenson. At about the same time that the decision was made to charge Dale Jenson, the Goodhue County Sheri9, Dean Albers, informed county attorney Steven Betcher that the sheri9 would seek the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") in an attempt to interview Dale Jenson. Dale Jenson had been interviewed in excess of 20 times between 1995 and 1999 by law enforcement o:cers from various agencies within the State of Minnesota. Sheri9 Albers indicated to the county attorney that FBI special agent Daniel Craft was highly experienced in interviewing subjects in similar cases. The Goodhue County Attorney's o:ce had no prior knowledge of, nor did they have any experience in working with Mr. Craft. On August 24, 1999, a meeting was held in the Goodhue County Law Enforcement Center to review with Agent Craft what had happened on the case to that point and the relevant Minnesota law pertaining to criminal suspect interviews.  During the meeting, Agent Craft asked what to do if Jenson requested an attorney. Craft was informed that in previous interviews Jenson had requested an attorney but then revoked the request. It was determined that should Jenson again request an attorney, Craft should ignore the request since it was likely that Jenson would revoke the request. 2 2 Present at this meeting were Goodhue County Sheri9 Dean Albers, Randy Mickelson, Patrick Thompson, Bob Dissell and Scott McNurlin, all of the Goodhue County Sheri9's Department, David Price of the Rochester o:ce of the FBI, Herm Dybezick of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and FBI Agent Daniel Craft. Goodhue County Attorney Steven Betcher and Assistant County Attorney Carol Lee also came to the meeting after it had commenced but where not present for all portions of the meeting. On August 25, 1999, Dale Jenson was asked to come to the Dakota County Law Enforcement Center in Hastings, Minnesota to meet with the law enforcement o:cers. Jenson was living in Hastings at that time and he complied with the request. FBI Agent Craft then conducted an interview with Dale Jenson that lasted approximately three hours and ten minutes. The interview was both videotaped and audiotaped. At the beginning of the 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 4/18 interview, Jenson was only told part of the Miranda warning. He was not informed that if he could not a9ord an attorney one would be appointed for him before any questioning and that at any time during the questioning he could exercise the protections provided by the Miranda warning. He was also not asked if he speci7cally waived his Miranda rights. During the interview, Dale Jenson talked about the need for an attorney and at one point said, \"I want an attorney.\" The interview continued without Jenson talking to a lawyer. Jenson subsequently confessed that he had accidentally killed Jessica and hid her body. That same day, he led law enforcement o:cers to where he had hidden her body. On August 26, 1999, Dale Jenson was arraigned on a felony complaint. Mary D. Wing7eld, Assistant District Public Defender, was appointed to represent Jenson. The state provided Jenson and his counsel complete copies of the interview tapes along with other discovery materials. On September 17, 1999, at a pretrial hearing before the Honorable Richard C. Perkins, Ms. Wing7eld, counsel for Jenson, informed the court that Jenson wished to waive the omnibus hearing and intended to plead guilty to manslaughter in the second degree. At the plea and sentencing hearing on September 24, 1999, before the Honorable Richard C. Perkins, the Goodhue County Attorney Steven Betcher and First Assistant County Attorney Carol Lee appeared on behalf of the state and Mary Wing7eld and Anthony Ho, another assistant district public defender, appeared on behalf of Jenson. Scott Swanson from the state public defender's o:ce also appeared. Jenson entered a plea of guilty to one count of manslaughter in the second degree with the charges of kidnaping and deprivation of parental rights being dismissed as a condition of the entry of guilt on the manslaughter charge. When directly questioned by the court, the defendant admitted that he understood the charge and entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter in the second degree. Upon further questioning by the court and by Ms. Wing7eld, the factual basis for the manslaughter guilty plea was placed on the record. Jenson further stated that his attorney had adequately represented his interests and that he had no further questions regarding the proceeding. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 5/18 Subsequent questioning placed a knowing waiver of defendant's right to an omnibus hearing on the record, at which time the issue of probable cause and the confession could be raised. The record clearly re8ects that both the defendant and his attorney knew of the constitutional issues that could have been raised at an evidentiary hearing and that a hearing might have determined that the FBI agent had violated Jenson's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in light of the way that the interview was conducted. Jenson expressly waived his right to contest these constitutional issues. Jenson did not appeal his guilty plea to the Minnesota Court of Appeals or the Minnesota Supreme Court. Jenson has now 7led suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unnamed Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging that all of the named defendants, in their individual and o:cial capacities, violated: (1) plainti9's constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution ; (2) plainti9's rights under Article I, Section 6, 7 and 8 of the Minnesota Constitution; and (3) plainti9's rights pursuant to State v. Scales, 518 N.W.2d 587 (Minn. 1994) and Minn. Stat. § 481.10 (1998). 3 3 Plainti9 brings these claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. While plainti9 asserts in his complaint a cause of action for conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985, he later acknowledges in his memorandum that this was an error and any conspiracy claim should be considered under § 1983. (See Pl.'s Mem. at 28-29 (\"The court should take heed of these paragraphs [pleading conspiracy], and view the conspiracies pleaded at Claims IV and V as conspiracies under sec. 1983, not sec. 1985(3) as mistakenly pleaded.\").) DISCUSSION I. Standard of Review Defendants bring a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) (6), the court must accept as true, in a hypothetical sense, all of the factual allegations in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Riley v. St. Louis County, Mo., 153 F.3d 627, 630 (8th Cir. 1998). A motion to dismiss for failing to state a claim should be granted if it is beyond doubt that no relief can be granted under any set of facts when the allegations are construed in a light most favorable to the pleader. County of St. Charles v. Missouri Family 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 6/18 Health Council, 107 F.3d 682, 684 (8th Cir. 1997). Rule 12(b)(6) requires a court to treat a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 when the parties present matters outside the pleadings that the court does not exclude. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); see also Gibb v. Scott, 958 F.2d 814, 816 (8th Cir. 1992). The parties have submitted a substantial number of documents outside the pleadings for consideration in this matter. While the court determines that defendants are entitled to a Rule 12 dismissal since plainti9 fails to state a viable claim on the pleadings as is discussed in part II of this order, the court also 7nds, alternatively, that when the court considered matters outside of the pleadings in parts III and IV of this order, defendants are also entitled to summary judgment.4 4 In particular, the court reviewed the transcripts of the August 25, 1999, interview and the September 24, 1999 plea and sentencing hearing in state court. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating to the court that no genuine issue of material fact exists. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). A fact is material only when its resolution a9ects the outcome of the case. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that it could cause a reasonable jury to return a verdict for either party. See id. at 250. On a motion for summary judgment, all evidence and inferences are to be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See id. at 255. The nonmoving party, however, may not rest upon mere denials or allegations in the pleadings, but must set forth speci7c facts su:cient to raise a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Moreover, if a plainti9 cannot support each essential element of its claim, summary judgment must be granted because a complete failure of proof regarding an essential element necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. See id. at 322-23. With these standards at hand, the court considers the defendants' motions. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 7/18 II. Plainti9 Presents No Viable Constitutional Law Claims A. No Cause Of Action Under Miranda The essence of plainti9's assertion of a violation of his constitutional rights is his allegation that defendants conspired to violate his Miranda rights during the interrogation on August 25, 1999. Plainti9 speci7cally asserts that defendant Daniel Craft repeatedly ignored his requests for an attorney and continued to question him after he indicated to Craft that he wanted an attorney.5 5 The Miranda rule only applies to statements made during custodial interrogations. Here, defendants assert that plainti9 was not in custody for purposes of Miranda since he voluntarily came to the police station, was interviewed in an unlocked room, was free to leave at any point during his interview, and at one point, even left the interview room unaccompanied to use the restroom. Although the court tends to agree with defendants' assertion since it is not entirely convinced that the facts demonstrate that plainti9 was in custody for purposes of Miranda at the time that he confessed, the court concludes that it need not directly resolve this issue given its 7nding that plainti9's case fails on the other legal bases discussed. Plainti9's § 1983 claim on the basis of this alleged constitutional violation, however, is foreclosed by the controlling law in this circuit. In Warren v. City of Lincoln, 864 F.2d 1436, 1442 (8th Cir. 1989), the Eighth Circuit held that no cause of action arises under § 1983 for a failure to a9ord a detainee his rights under Miranda. Instead, the only remedy for a Miranda violation is the exclusion from evidence of any compelled testimony arising therefrom. See id. Since defendant has no cause of action under the controlling law of this circuit, defendants' motions to dismiss must be granted.6 6 The court also concludes that plainti9 cannot sidestep well-settled Eighth Circuit precedent by restyling this matter as a \"non-Miranda violation case\" under the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (See Pl.'s Mem at 35, n. 8.) Plainti9's reliance on Ninth Circuit caselaw is misplaced in light of this Circuit's clear ruling in Warren that a plainti9 cannot maintain an action for questioning \"outside\" Miranda. See Warren, 864 F.2d at 1442. Moreover, the undisputed circumstances of this case are factually inapposite to the substantive due process cases that plainti9 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 8/18 Plainti9 has also brought a claim under the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel \"requires the existence of both `criminal prosecution' and an `accused.'\" United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 180, 188 (1984). attempts to rely on. See, e.g., Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936) (confession extracted by beating defendants); Gray v. Spillman, 925 F.2d 90 (4th Cir. 1990) (defendant beaten by police); Wilkins v. May, 872 F.2d 190 (7th Cir. 1989) (confession extracted after police handcu9ed defendant and held gun to his head); Ware v. Reed, 709 F.2d 345 (5th Cir. 1983) (beating during interrogation); Duncan v. Nelson, 466 F.2d 939 (7th Cir. 1972) (suspect kept in solitary con7nement for 18 day before being handcu9ed to chair for 4 hours before confessing). B. No Cause Of Action Under the Sixth Amendment The right \"does not attach until after the initiation of formal charges.\" Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 431 (1986). Thus, a Sixth Amendment right only attaches \"at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings — whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\" Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689 (1972). The mere fact that plainti9 was the focus of a criminal investigation does not cause the right to attach. See United States v. Ingle, 157 F.3d 1147, 1151 (8th Cir. 1998); Warren, 864 F.2d at 1442. Moreover, \"the 7ling of a criminal complaint and the issuance of an arrest warrant do not constitute the initiation of an adverse judicial proceeding for purposes of [the Sixth Amendment right to counsel]\". Von Kahl v. United States, 242 F.3d 783, 789 (8th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Here, plainti9 has not pleaded facts, nor can he plead facts, that fall within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It is undisputed that Jenson voluntarily came to the sheri9's o:ce and that no formal criminal proceeding had been implemented at the time of the interview. The court thus concludes that plainti9's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not triggered. Accordingly, the court concludes that plainti9's Sixth Amendment claim fails and must be dismissed.7 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 9/18 Defendants also argue that plainti9 has no cause of action under Bivens v. Six Unnamed Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Bivens allows federal causes of action for injuries arising from the unconstitutional conduct of law enforcement agents. Bivens, 403 U.S. at 397. Here, plainti9's Bivens claim is predicated upon the alleged violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. 7 The court notes that plainti9 appears to concede that his Sixth Amendment claim fails as a matter of law since he acknowledges in his memorandum that he \"does not rest [his opposition to defendants's motions] upon the Sixth Amendment.\" (See Pl.'s Mem. at 28.) Instead, \"Mr. Jenson rests his opposition . . . on the substantive due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\" (Id.) C. No Cause Of Action Under Bivens However, since the court 7nds that no violation occurred under either amendment, plainti9's Bivens claim fails. Furthermore, a Bivens cause of action for an alleged constitutional violation will not lie in one of two instances: (1) when the defendant demonstrates \"special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of a:rmative action by Congress;\" and (2) when the defendant shows that \"Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally e9ective.\" Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18-19 (1980). Defendants assert that since there already exists a remedy to protect those persons allegedly denied their Fifth Amendment Miranda rights, namely, the exclusionary-rule that dictates that any evidence obtained in violation of Miranda will be excluded at trial, there exists no separate Bivens cause of action for the same alleged violation. The court agrees, especially when considering the unambiguous precedent of this Circuit. See Warren, 864 F.2d at 1422 (holding that no constitutional tort action lies for a Miranda violation, rather, exclusionary rule constitutes aggrieved party's remedy). Accordingly, the court concludes that any claim plainti9 asserts under Bivens must be dismissed as a matter of law. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 10/18 III. Plainti9's Previous Guilty Plea Precludes Him From Re-litigating the Constitutionality of His Interrogation Notwithstanding the foregoing grounds for dismissal under Rule 12, there is an additional basis for granting defendants summary judgment since plainti9 pleaded guilty to second degree manslaughter in Minnesota state court. Plainti9 did not appeal or challenge that plea. In fact, plainti9 expressly acknowledged and waived the same constitutional claims that he now tries to assert in the present action. During his plea and sentencing hearing on September 24, 1999, plainti9, under oath, engaged in the following allocation with his counsel: Plainti9's Counsel: There are some things that have come up as well, and that is with regard to the taking of your statement, and that's a constitutional issue that would have been heard at a later evidentiary hearing. The issue would have been whether the o:cer violated your Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights in doing so, I am speaking of the special agent involved from the F.B.I; do you understand that? Jenson: Yes. Plainti9's Counsel: If you were to be successful in that regard, that doesn't mean that your case would be dismissed but, it does mean the evidence they obtained, if the Judge would so rule, would not be used against you, not in the State's case-in-chief, anyway; you understand that? Jenson: Yes. Plainti9's Counsel: Again, by pleading guilty here this afternoon, you will not be able to visit that issue either later or should you subsequently change your mind that you want to have a hearing on that, you are giving up that right? Jensen: Yes. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 11/18 (See Transcript of Plea and Sentencing Hearing, Betcher A9., Ex. D at 8-9.) Plainti9 does not deny that he waived these constitutional issues in that hearing. In fact, he speci7cally acknowledges in his complaint that: Subsequent to questioning placed a knowing waiver to defendant's right to an Omnibus hearing on the record, at which time the issue of probable cause and confession could be raised. It is clear from the record that both the defendant and his attorney knew of the constitutional issues that could have been raised at an evidentiary hearing and that an evidentiary hearing might determine that the FBI agent had violated this [sic] 5th and 6th Amendment rights in conducting the interview in the manner it was conducted. (Compl. at 4.) Plainti9's guilty plea in state court must result in a waiver of the claims that he now attempts to raise. See Williams v. Scharo, 93 F.3d 527, 528 (8th Cir. 1996) (guilty plea forecloses subsequent § 1983 action). Under Minnesota law, and the law of the Eighth Circuit, a guilty plea entered by defendant represented by counsel \"operates as a waiver to all non-jurisdictional claims\" including constitutional claims. State of Minnesota v. Lothenbach, 296 N.W.2d 854, 857 (Minn. 1980); United States of America v. Vong, 171 F.3d 648, 654 (8th Cir. 1999). Minnesota's Supreme Court used the United States Supreme Court's words to describe the waiver e9ect of a guilty plea: A guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. When a criminal defendant had solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the o9ense with which he is charged, he may not therefore raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. Lothenbach, 296 N.W.2d at 857 (quoting Tollet v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973)). Moreover, long standing Minnesota law holds that all of plainti9's constitutional law claims fail because he waived them as part of his guilty plea. See State of Minnesota v. Murphy, 545 N.W.2d 909, 918 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 12/18 (Minn. 1996); State ex rel. Boswell v. Tahash, 278 Minn. 408, 415, 154 N.W.2d 813, 817 (1967). There is no dispute that the interview occurred before Jenson pleaded guilty in court. Plainti9 also acknowledges that when he entered that plea, he knowingly waived his right to challenge the alleged events of which he now complains. (See Compl. at 4.) On this basis, Jenson has waived any challenge to the underlying constitutionality of his interview with Agent Craft, and the court believes that defendants are entitled to summary judgment. IV. Other Bases Preclude Re-Litigation of Claim Arising From Interview Defendants also assert that Jenson is precluded from re-litigating the constitutionality of the August 25, 1999, interview on several other bases: (1) under the Rooker-Feldman Doctrine this court may not review a state court's proceeding that would e9ectively reverse the state court decision; (2) under the doctrine of collateral estoppel plainti9 is barred from re- litigating this matter; and (3) when considering the Supreme Court's decision in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), plainti9 is precluded from bringing this type of claim under § 1983. The court agrees with defendants that all of these bases provide further reason why plainti9's case fails. A. Rooker-Feldman Defendants correctly assert that plainti9's claim is barred by Rooker- Feldman. Under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, federal district courts do not have jurisdiction to review challenges to state court decisions. District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923). A federal action is precluded \"if the relief requested in the federal action would e9ectively reverse the state court decision or void its rulings.\" Charchenko v. City of Stillwater, 47 F.3d 981, 983 (8th Cir. 1995) (noting that \"the only court with jurisdiction to review decisions of state courts is the United States Supreme Court\"). In applying the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, a court must determine: 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 13/18 [E]xactly what the state court held and whether the relief requested by [plainti9] in his federal action require determining the state court's decision is wrong or would void its ruling. If the relief requested in the federal action requires determining that the state court decision is wrong or would void the state court's ruling, then the issues are inextricably intertwined and the district court has no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the suit. Id. The Eighth Circuit has further explained: [T]he federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it. Where federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court is wrong, it is di:cult to conceive the federal proceeding as, in the substance, anything other than a prohibited appeal of the state court judgment. Keene Corp. v. Cass, 908 F.2d 293, 296-297 (8th Cir. 1990) (citing Penzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 25 (1987)). The issues raised here by Jenson are premised on the claim that he was subjected to a custodial interrogation without access to his legal counsel. Jenson, however, entered into a plea agreement in state court and the court relied upon Jenson's waiver as a part of accepting his guilty plea, the plea agreement and when entering judgment against him. Clearly, plainti9's present federal claims are inextricably intertwined with the state court conviction. In order for Jenson to succeed in the present lawsuit, this court would have to 7nd that plainti9's constitutional rights were violated and that he did not waive in state court his right to challenge the confession arising out of the August 25, 1999, interview. The e9ect of such a 7nding would be to void or invalidate his guilty plea. In other words, in order for this case to proceed, this court would have to reverse the state court and set aside plainti9's plea. This is an action that is prohibited under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. As a result, the court concludes that plainti9's claims are precluded by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 14/18 B. Collateral Estoppel Defendants also correctly assert that plainti9 is barred by collateral estoppel. It is well settled that issues decided in state criminal proceedings may estop subsequent litigation for violations of civil rights under § 1983. See Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 104 (1980); Simmons v. O'Brien, 77 F.3d 1093, 1096 (8th Cir. 1996). Under the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, a federal court generally must a9ord a state court's determination the same preclusive a9ect that it would receive in the state's own courts. Marrese v. Am. Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380 (1985); Teleconnect Co. v. Ensrud, 55 F.3d 357, 361 (8th Cir. 1995). Federal courts look 7rst to the law of the state to \"promote comity between state and federal courts that has been recognized as a bulwark of the federal system.\" Allen, 449 U.S. at 96. Because state law applies, the court must examine Minnesota law and determine what preclusive e9ect its courts would give to plainti9's guilty plea and knowing waiver of any constitutional challenges to the August 25, 1999, interview. The standards for invoking collateral estoppel in Minnesota are set forth in Kaiser v. Northern States Power Co., 353 N.W.2d 899, 902 (Minn. 1984): 1. The issue is identical to one in a prior adjudication; 2. There was a 7nal judgment on the merits; 3. The estopped party was a party in privity with a party to the prior adjudication; and 4. The estopped party was given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the adjudicated issue. After careful review, the court has considered all four factors required for collateral estoppel and determines that all four factors are satis7ed here. Accordingly, plainti9 is barred from relitigating the constitutionality of the interview and his subsequent guilty plea. First, the Miranda issue was addressed in the state criminal proceeding. (See Transcript of Plea Hearing at 8-9.) Clearly, the claims that Jenson now asserts are identical to the ones that he could have raised in state court had 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 15/18 he not entered a guilty plea. Plainti9 and his attorneys had a full opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of his confession in state court but voluntarily chose to waive such challenge. Second, there was a 7nal judgment on the merits. The state court accepted plainti9's voluntary and counseled guilty plea. Plainti9 was sentenced. Plainti9 did not appeal. Third, the plainti9 was a party to, and the defendants are in privity with, the state court criminal proceeding. Fourth, plainti9 had a full and fair opportunity to challenge the constitutionality of his confession in the criminal proceeding. However, plainti9 chose not to challenge the constitutionality of his interrogation and confession in the state court proceeding, nor did he choose to appeal his voluntary and counseled guilty plea. Therefore, all four elements of collateral estoppel have been satis7ed, and plainti9 should not be allowed to re-litigate the constitutionality of his arrest and interrogation. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this basis. C. Heck Doctrine Defendants also correctly assert that plainti9's claims under § 1983 are precluded by the Supreme Court's holding in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994). In Heck, the Supreme Court held that to recover damages for an unconstitutional conviction or sentence, \"a section 1983 plainti9 must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on appeal, expunged by executive order, [or] declared invalid by a state court or in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.\" Until the conviction or sentence has been overturned, the claim is not cognizable under § 1983. See id. Here, for plainti9 to prevail he would need to negate the confession arising from the FBI interrogation and his subsequent guilty plea. Plainti9 fails to make such a showing. He never directly challenged his guilty plea and the court is not aware of any attempt to obtain habeas relief. As a consequence, the court concludes that Heck provides another basis for precluding plainti9's claims under § 1983 and granting defendants' motions.8 8 The court also notes that while defendants make persuasive arguments regarding the issue of immunity, the court will not address the immunity 2/22/2021 Jenson v. Craft, Civil No. 01-1488(DSD/JMM) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/jenson-v-craft 16/18 Plainti9 also alleges that defendants violated provisions of the Minnesota State Constitution and various state statutes. Since this court is dismissing all of the federal claims, it concludes that it no longer has jurisdiction over the state law claims and these claims will be dismissed without prejudice. See 28 U.C. §§ 1367(a) and (c)(3); United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966); Richmond v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Minnesota, 957 F.2d 595, 598-99 (8th Cir. 1992). For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: issue given its determination to dismiss this case on the several bases already discussed. V. Minnesota State Law Claims 9 CONCLUSION 1. Defendants' motions to dismiss, or in the alternative for summary judgment [Docket Nos. 18, 21, 24, 28, 44 and 48], are granted; 2. Plainti9's Claims I, II, III, IV, V, VI of his complaint are dismissed with prejudice; and 3. Plainti9's Claims VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII of his complaint are dismissed without prejudice.

Paulsen, Assistant United States Attorney, United States Attorney's O:ce, 300 South Fourth Street, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55415 (for the Government); and Frederick J. Goetz, Goetz & Eckland PA, 43 Main Street Southeast, Suite 505, Minneapolis, MN 55414 (for Defendant). This matter is before the Court, United States Magistrate Judge Tony N. Leung, on Defendant's Motion to Suppress Statements (ECF No. 20) and Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of Search and Seizure (ECF No. 25). These motions have been referred to the undersigned for a report and recommendation to the district court, the Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, under 28 U.S.C. § 636 and D. Minn. LR 72.1(a)(3). A hearing was held on September 16, 2014. Assistant United States Attorney Je9rey S. Paulsen appeared on behalf of the United States of America (the Government). Attorney Frederick J. Goetz appeared on behalf of Defendant Fahad Abdihakim Diriye. The Court heard testimony from O:cer Scott Aikins of the Minneapolis Police Department. The Court received the following exhibits: Defendant's Exhibit 1, a *2  supplement report of Minneapolis Police O:cer John Staufenberg, and Defendant's Exhibit 2, a supplement report of Minneapolis Police O:cer Hien Dinh. 2 Post-hearing brie7ng is now complete and these motions are ripe for a determination by the Court. I. Based upon the 7le and documents contained therein, along with the testimony presented and exhibits received, the undersigned Magistrate Judge makes the following: FINDINGS On the evening of June 25, 2014, O:cer Aikins responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a parking lot at Thomas Beach near Lake Calhoun. The car was thought to be involved in an armed robbery  that occurred in 1 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 3/12 downtown Minneapolis a few days earlier. The robbery had taken place on June 22 and, on June 24, suspects in the robbery had been observed in the car. At the time, no suspects were in custody. The dispatch also indicated that a gun was possibly involved in the robbery. (Def. Ex. 1.) 1 At times, this incident is referred to as a robbery and, at other times, it is referred to as a burglary. For purposes of these motions, the precise crime is irrelevant. Three squads, including O:cer Aikins, arrived at the scene and parked approximately one to two squad-lengths away from the car. According to O:cer Aikins, law enforcement \"basically swarmed over the car.\" A man and a woman were ordered out of the car, handcu9ed, and placed in the responding squads. Approximately, 15 minutes later, while law enforcement was determining what to do with the car, another male, later identi7ed as Defendant, walked up to the car, opened the driver's door, and *3  began to get inside. (Id.) O:cers ran over to the car and ordered Defendant out. At the time, the car had not yet been searched or secured. 3 Defendant exited the vehicle with his hands up and was handcu9ed by O:cer Aikins. While Defendant and O:cer Aikins were standing next to the car, Defendant appeared to be continuously turning away from O:cer Aikins, trying to turn his right side away from O:cer Aikins. Defendant was told to settle down, but did not comply. O:cer Aikins was concerned that Defendant might be trying to grab a weapon and began patting him down. O:cer Aikins immediately felt a hard, L-shaped object in Defendant's pocket, which he recognized as a handgun. O:cer Aikins reached into Defendant's pocket and removed a loaded handgun. At the hearing, O:cer Aikins acknowledged that Defendant was not named in the dispatch, he did not observe Defendant commit any crime, he had no speci7c information linking Defendant to the car, he did not observe Defendant take anything out or put anything in the car, and Defendant did not try to 8ee. II. Based upon the foregoing Findings, the undersigned makes the following: 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 4/12 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Defendant asserts that law enforcement lacked reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity and moves for suppression of all evidence obtained as the result of his seizure and the statements he made to law enforcement during an interview *4  the day following.  Defendant argues that the dispatch on which law enforcement relied \"did not contain any individual suspect description []or any other information speci7c to [him] that connected him with the robbery,\" only the car. (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 7, ECF No. 32.) Defendant also argues that law enforcement did not have reasonable suspicion that the car was involved in the earlier robbery. In addition, Defendant argues that, even if law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to stop the car, it was not \"reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to seize anybody who might walk up to the vehicle and open a door some three days after the crime occurred.\" (Id. at 8.) 4 2 2 In Defendant's motion to suppress statements, Defendant identi7es both statements made on June 25 and during the interview on June 26. (Def.'s Mot. to Suppress Statements ¶ 1.) At the hearing, however, Defendant clari7ed that he was just challenging the June 26 statement.   -------- A. Investigatory Stop \"A police o:cer may conduct a brief, investigatory stop of an individual if the o:cer reasonably suspects that the individual is involved in criminal activity.\" United States v. Lawhorn, 735 F.3d 817, 820 (8th Cir. 2013) (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968)). \"Reasonable suspicion must be based on speci7c, articulable facts. In determining whether an o:cer had reasonable suspicion based on speci7c, articulable facts, [courts] look at the totality of the circumstances, allowing o:cers to draw on their experience and training.\" Id. (quotation and citation omitted). \"Reasonable suspicion does not require 'absolute[] certain[ty];' rather an o:cer must observe 'unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.'\" Id. at 821 (alteration in original) (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 27, 30). \"While reasonable suspicion must be more than an inchoate hunch, the Fourth *5  Amendment only requires that police articulate some minimal, objective justi7cation for an investigatory 5 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 5/12 stop.\" United States v. Walker, 555 F.3d 716, 719 (8th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). \"In deciding whether to conduct a Terry stop, an o:cer may rely on information provided by other o:cers as well as any information known to the team of o:cers conducting the investigation.\" United States v. Allen, 705 F.3d 367, 370 (8th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted). Similarly, \"[t]he Fourth Amendment permits an investigatory stop of a vehicle if o:cers have a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle or its occupants are involved in criminal activity. In such a case, o:cers may brie8y stop an individual and make reasonable inquiries aimed at con7rming or dispelling the suspicion.\" United States v. Smith, 648 F.3d 654, 658 (8th Cir. 2011) (quotations and citation omitted). At the time law enforcement approached the car, they knew that the car matched the description of a vehicle involved in a robbery occurring just a few days before for which no one was in custody. This information provided a reasonable basis to stop the car and its occupants to investigate possible associations with the robbery and con7rm or dispel suspicions regarding the car's involvement. Id.; see Lawhorn, 735 F.3d at 821 (reasonable suspicion existed to stop vehicle where \"upon arriving at the lot[,] the o:cers found a car matching the caller's description, shined a spotlight at the car, and observed the car's occupant to look back at them wide-eyed and reach quickly into the back seat\"); Allen, 705 F.3d at 370 (law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to stop SUV to investigate SUV's possible association with minivan where vehicles appeared to be travelling in tandem and large quantity of marijuana was found in minivan); see also *6  United States v. Marxen, 410 F.3d 326, 332 (6th Cir. 2005) (\"[W]e conclude that police are permitted to conduct a Terry stop to investigate completed felonies if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the vehicle stopped was involved in criminal activity and the stop may produce evidence of a crime even if o:cers do not have reasonable suspicion to believe that the owner and/or driver of the vehicle was directly involved in the criminal activity.\"). 6 Defendant argues that, even if there was reasonable suspicion to stop the car, there was no reasonable suspicion \"that [he] was involved in or wanted in connection with the robbery.\" (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 8.) The Government essentially concedes that law enforcement \"had no pre-existing 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 6/12 information tying [Defendant] to the armed robbery or the suspect vehicle.\" (Gov't's Mem. in Opp'n at 4, ECF No. 33.) The Government contends, however, that \"[D]efendant's own actions in entering the vehicle provided all the reasonable suspicion that was needed.\" (Id.) The Government contends that law enforcement could reasonably assume Defendant had \"some connection to the suspect vehicle or he would not have entered it. And, if [Defendant] was connected to the vehicle, there also was reasonable suspicion to believe he was connected to the robbery.\" (Id.) The Government also contends that because law enforcement \"had reason to believe there was a gun in the suspect vehicle\" and \"[t]hey had not searched the vehicle yet or secured it in any way,\" law enforcement had \"reasonable suspicion to believe [Defendant] was either trying to conceal or make o9 with evidence, or worse, attempting to access a weapon to use against the police.\" (Id. at 3.) *7 7 Defendant appears to be suggesting that his behavior was wholly innocent and that it is not \"reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to seize anybody who might walk up to . . . [a] vehicle and open a door some three days after the crime occurred.\" (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 8.) But \"[t]he behavior on which reasonable suspicion is grounded . . . need not establish that the suspect is probably guilty of a crime or eliminate innocent interpretations of the circumstances.\" United States v. Carpenter, 462 F.3d 891, 986 (8th Cir. 2006). Defendant walked up to a car believed to be involved in a recent armed robbery—a car which was essentially 8anked by squad cars—opened the driver's door, and began to seat himself in the vehicle. Based on Defendant's actions, it is not unreasonable to infer that he owned or had control over the car. It was reasonable for law enforcement to conclude that Defendant was associated with the car (and therefore potentially the robbery) and conduct a brief investigatory stop of Defendant to con7rm or dispel their suspicions. While there may be wholly innocent explanations for such conduct, it was not unreasonable under the circumstances for law enforcement to stop Defendant and investigate his connection to the car. Further, it was not unreasonable for law enforcement to handcu9 Defendant during the investigatory stop given the suspected use of a gun in the robbery they were investigating and the fact that law enforcement had not yet been able to clear the car (including removing any weapons present) after taking 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 7/12 the other two individuals into custody. See id. at 659 (\"As part of a lawful Terry stop, o:cers may take any measures that are reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\" (quotations omitted)); El-Ghazzawy v. Berthiaume, *8  363 F.3d 452, 457 (8th Cir. 2011) (\"'[F]or the use of handcu9s during a Terry stop, the Fourth Amendment requires some reasonable belief that the suspect is armed and dangerous or that the restraints are necessary for some other legitimate purpose, evaluated on the facts of each case.'\" (quoting Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 836 (6th Cir. 2005)). 8 Defendant likens this case to United States v. Hudson, 405 F.3d 425 (6th Cir. 2005). In Hudson, an armed robbery occurred at a convenience store in 2000. 405 F.3d at 428. Hudson, a black male, was identi7ed \"from a series of suspect photographs and a warrant was issued for [his] arrest.\" Id. at 428, 429, 433-34. Law enforcement was unable to locate Hudson. Id. at 428. Approximately one year later, the investigator received an anonymous tip from a colleague that a woman the investigator suspected was Hudson's girlfriend was working at another convenience store in the same town. Id. The tip stated that on a certain date, Hudson's girlfriend would arrive at the convenience store around 3:00 p.m. and be accompanied by Hudson. Id. In an e9ort to corroborate the tip, the investigator con7rmed the girlfriend's employment at the convenience store through the manager and learned that the girlfriend usually arrived ten minutes before her shift began. Id. at 428- 29. It was disputed whether the manager also con7rmed the type of car—a Ford Taurus—that Hudson's girlfriend drove. Id. at 429. In addition, based on his years as a police o:cer in the community, the investigator testi7ed that he knew that Hudson and his girlfriend were romantically involved and had a child. Id. Law enforcement set up at the convenience store to wait for Hudson's girlfriend to arrive. Id. Around 3:00 p.m., Hudson's girlfriend pulled into the parking lot in a Ford *9  Taurus. Id. She was accompanied by two black males and an infant. Id. Law enforcement \"approached the car with their 7rearms drawn in a so-called 'felony approach'\" because \"they suspected that Hudson might be armed since he had allegedly used a 7rearm to commit the robbery.\" Id. Only after the three individuals were searched and handcu9ed, 9 2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 8/12 and crack cocaine discovered on Hudson's person, did law enforcement con7rm their identities. Hudson moved to suppress the crack cocaine. See id. at 439. The Sixth Circuit concluded that the district court erred in denying Hudson's motion because the investigative stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion. Id. The Sixth Circuit noted that \"the tipster's most critical assertion—that Hudson would be in the car\"—had been discredited because, \"[w]hile [the investigator] testi7ed that the tip had included this prediction, [the investigator's] report, which he composed soon after receipt of the tip, makes no reference to it.\" Id. at 433. The Sixth Circuit concluded that law enforcement \"had no more than a hunch that Hudson would be accompanying [his girlfriend] to work on the day in question and no more than a hunch that one of the passengers in [her] car was Hudson.\" Id. at 434. Such a \"hunch\" lacked the speci7c and articulable facts needed to form reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. Id.; see also id. at 438 (\" [T]he tip upon which the government relies did not mention Hudson and consequently o9ers no support for the government's contention that o:cers reasonably suspected that Hudson was in the car.\"). The Sixth Circuit reasoned that, *10 10 [a]t most, [the investigator's] previous knowledge of Hudson and [his girlfriend] furnished the o:cers with reasonable suspicion that the two were a couple and shared a child. It is a signi7cant, and unreasonable, leap to deduce from this that the two were traveling together to the [convenience store] on [a certain date]. The leap is not made any less unreasonable by the fact that the two men accompanying [Hudson's girlfriend] were black, as the investigators knew Hudson to be. Of course, had the o:cers positively, or at least reasonably, identi7ed Hudson as a passenger before approaching [his girlfriend's] car with their guns drawn—for example, by reference to a photograph of Hudson, or a composite drawing— they would have had reasonable suspicion to seize the car and its occupants. But, lacking reasonable suspicion, the o:cers elected to seize 7rst and identify second.  2/22/2021 United States v. Diriye, Case No. 14-cr-236(1) (JNE/TNL) | Casetext Search + Citator https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-diriye 9/12 Id. at 433-34 (footnoted omitted); see also id. at 438 (\"[T]he facts that Hudson is black and once had a relationship with [the girlfriend] do not provide a particularized basis for suspecting he was in the car.\"). The Sixth Circuit was also \"mindful that . . . [law enforcement] w[as] not attempting to solve a recently committed crime, or an ongoing one, but rather to arrest a person suspected of having committed a felony over a year earlier.\" Id. at 436-37. The Sixth Circuit observed that \"resolution of the question whether reasonable suspicion existed in the 7rst instance must be sensitive to whether the Terry stop was made to investigate a crime committed beyond the recent past.\" Id. at 437. Hudson is distinguishable in several respects. First, whereas over a year had passed between the armed robbery and the investigatory stop in Hudson, only a few days had passed between the armed robbery in this case and the investigatory stop of Defendant. Second, law enforcement had no reasonable suspicion for stopping the car in *11  Hudson. Before stopping the car, they did not con7rm that Hudson was in fact one of the passengers; they did not observe any violation of a tra:c law; and there was no indication that the car was connected to the crime under investigation. In this case, the car was the connection to the armed robbery. Third, Hudson engaged in no unusual conduct—he was merely a passenger in a vehicle. Here, Defendant walked up to a car that was 8anked by police o:cers, opened the driver's door, and began seating himself in the vehicle. Under the circumstances, Defendant's behavior was highly suspicious. Moreover, there is a question of o:cer safety in the present case. 11 Based on the totality of the circumstances, Defendant's conduct provided law enforcement with reasonable suspicion to stop Defendant and investigate his connection to the car. B. Statements \"If . . . [law enforcement] o:cers conduct an illegal search or detention, physical evidence from the search as well as verbal evidence obtained from the detention must be excluded as the 'fruits' of the o:cers' unlawful action.\" United States v. Cotter, 701 F.3d 544, 547 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 484-85 (1963)); accord United States v. Yousif, 2/22/2021 United States v.

Defendant's only argument for the suppression of his statements is that they were fruits of the illegal investigatory stop. (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. at 10-11.) Because the *12  Court concludes that the investigatory stop was proper under the Fourth Amendment, there is no basis upon which to suppress the statements. 12 III. Based upon the foregoing Findings and Conclusions, the undersigned Magistrate Judge makes the following: RECOMMENDATION For the reasons set forth herein, IT IS HEREBY RECOMMENDED that: 1. Defendant's Motion to Suppress Statements (ECF No. 20) be DENIED.   2. Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of Search and Seizure (ECF No. 25) be DENIED.   s/ Tony N.

      "Too_Long1    Arbitration   LELS (Mathew Aish)/Columbia Heights Police Department    Grievance Arbitration Between:        BMS Case No.: 20 PA-1575    Columbia Heights Police Dept. (Employer)   and   Law Enforcement Labor Services Inc. (LELS)  Mathew Aish (Grievant)     REPRESENTATION  Representing Columbia Heights Police Department  Joan Quade, Attorney   BARNA, GUZY & STEFFEN, LTD.    Representing Mathew Aish:  Renee Zachman, Attorney  Mark Schneider, Attorney  Law Enforcement Labor Services  ISSUE  Did the employer have Just Cause to Terminate Mathew Aish?  If not, what is the appropriate Remedy?    INTRODUCTION  Mathew Aish was a police officer in Columbia Heights hired in 1999 and terminated on January 15, 2020.  Law  Enforcement Labor Services responded to the termination by filing a step one grievance on January 27, 2020.  The termination stems primarily from an incident that occurred on October 27, 2019 in which the grievant,  Mathew Aish, responded to a dispatch call regarding a driver operating a vehicle recklessly on city streets in  2    Columbia Heights and Fridley. The description relayed by dispatch was that of a white Taurus driving at speeds  up to 80 miles per hour and traveling north in south bound lanes of traffic.   The concerns raised by the City leading to their decision to terminate revolve around the follow up reporting of  this incident by Mathew Aish including concerns of truthfulness, accuracy and complying with a direct order to  activate body worn camera at all times when engaging with non-departmental personnel. This direct order came  about as a result of a 2006 incident in which Mr. Aish had falsely represented the sobriety test of another police  officer from a neighboring jurisdiction.  Due to the dishonesty involved in that event Mr. Aish was determined,  by the Anoka County Attorney’s Office, to be Brady impaired. As result of this designation the City is  compelled to reveal the issues of Aish’s dishonesty to defense council when Mr. Aish is involved in the  prosecution of a crime.  As a result of the 2006 incident the City imposed a requirement that Mr. Aish activate  his body worn camera whenever interacting with non-departmental personnel in an effort to diminish credibility  questions that would likely arise at subsequent criminal proceedings that involved Mr. Aish testifying on behalf  of the City and to create a process that would enable the City to keep Mr. Aish employed.    An Arbitration hearing was held at the Columbia Heights Police Department offices on August 17 to 19, 2020.    FACTS  Mathew Aish was terminated on January 15, 2020 after 20 plus years of services as a police officer for the city  of Columbia Heights. The incident that is largely the basis for this termination occurred at approximately 2:30  PM that afternoon in which a Columbia Heights Dispatcher announced that there was a driver proceeding  recklessly on the streets of Columbia Heights. Two Columbia Heights police officers, Officer Joseph Pikala and  Officer Mathew Aish, responded separately to the radio call. Due to the positioning of their squads it was Aish  who was able first to get eyes on the reckless driver and position his squad behind the driver.  Aish provided the  radio contact after beginning to trail the reckless driver.  He explained that he was traveling north on Main street  crossing highway 694.  This triggered the movement and positioning of two Fridley squads, one driven by  3    Officer Elasky and the other driven by an officer in training, Officer Bulman accompanied in his squad by  Officer Fetrow. Both Fridley squads were positioned on Main Street facing south and waited as Aish following  the suspect drove by them northbound. Once the reckless driver reached the two Fridley squads the Fridley  officers turned on sirens, pulled a U turn and got in behind Aish. Almost immediately after the Fridley Squads  completed their U turns the reckless driver ran a stop sign and Aish followed right behind through that stop  sign.  Aish announced that the driver was speeding up and said “This is going to be a pursuit and I am getting  out.”  At that time Aish pulled over to the curb and the Two Fridley officers fell in behind the reckless driver.   Video footage from the rear of Officer Elasky’s car showed that once the Fridley squads passed Aish he pulled  back out into traffic and began to follow behind the Fridley squads.  It was clear in the rear camera video that  once back in the traffic Aish turned his light back on and began to follow.  GPS systems installed on the Fridley  squads also recorded the speed the cars were traveling indicating that they were moving as fast as 58 mph.  The  front view camera on Bulman’s car also clearly shows the reckless driver turning left and running an additional  stop sign and then turning right onto a residential street.  It was at this time Fridley officers talked about  conducting a PIT maneuver on the reckless driver.  Bulman who was first behind the reckless driver was unable  to do the PIT as Bulman was a trainee and not qualified to initiate a PIT. Elasky said he would PIT and  proceeded to pass Bulman and performed the PIT disabling the White Taurus. Immediately behind Elasky were  Bulman and Fetrow in a Fridley squad and right behind them, just seconds behind Elasky was Aish. All the  officers, including Aish, ran up to the disabled car with guns drawn.  Fetrow can be heard clearly screaming get  your hands up. The driver was immediately pulled from his car and apprehended.    Once the driver was cuffed he was immediately was put in a Fridley squad car. At this point body cameras  caught the debriefing that occurred amongst the officers.  It is clear that shortly after the offender is place in the  Fridley squad Aish turns off his body camera.  Elasky continues to run his body camera and it is clear on his  camera that Aish asks in a quiet tone, “Are you on?” referring to body camera.  Elasky say “yes” and apologizes  and explains that he has to stay on.   4    A few hours later Aish submits an incident report of the event referring the action as “Reckless driver  complaint/ assist to Fridley PD”. The report does not refer to the action as a pursuit and thus not prompting the  required state documentation of a pursuit. The city takes issue with charactorizing this as an assist to another  department and concludes that under Columbia Heights policy as well as State law this should have been filed  as a Pursuit report and a state report submitted.  Statements within the report that the City takes issue with are as  follows:  1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to  accelerate again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several  blocks now, I had been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to  continue and pulled over and let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to  accelerate northbound on Main Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the  suspect blow through the stop sign and intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop  (Emphasis added)  2) I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over and  stop. I followed at the posted speed limit (Emphasis Added).  3)  I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.  The  Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and Trinity. I  activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody (Emphasis added).  The City claims each of the above identified statements in the report are false and intentionally written that way  to minimize Aish’s involvement in the event and thus making the event not appear as though it was a pursuit. If  not a determined to be a pursuit then less reporting required and therefore no issue for failure to properly  document. The video footage from Fridley squads confirms the inaccuracies in Aish’s report.  Fridley squad  footage and corresponding sound recording clearly shows Aish following suspect blowing through the stop sign  at 57th Ave and stating suspect is accelerating and then stating he is pulling out.  Secondly, the reports states he  was following at the posted speed. The Fridley squad GPS computers record the vehicle speed. The computer  5    vehicle recorded speeds are contemporaneous with the video and show speeds of as much as 58 mph as the  Fridley squads pursued and at the same time also showed Aish following right behind.  In addition, the video  also shows Aish arriving within just a few seconds of the completed PIT once again indicating he would have  had to be moving as fast as the speeds of the recorded for the Fridley squads. Finally Aish reported that he did  not turn on his emergency lights until he was on Starlight Street and after the PIT was completed.  The rear  camera view from Office Elasky’s car shows he actually turned on his emergency lights shortly after the Fridley  squads passed him on Main Street and kept them on while following the Fridley squads.  In addition to vehicle video footage body camera footage was also presented at the hearing.  The body camera  footage from Officer Aish was turned on as Aish arrived at the scene where the suspect was apprehended.   Aish’s body camera remained on until the suspect was placed in the Fridley squad at which point he turned off  his camera.  Body camera video of Elasky remained on after Aish had turned his off.  It is clear in Elasky’s  video that Aish walks up to him and asks in a low voice if Elasky is “on” understood to mean is your body  camera on to which Elasky apologizes and says yes and indicates he is required to have it on. Elasky body  camera reveals that Aish did continue to have conversations with two Fridley officers about the events leading  to the PIT that this discussion was not recorded on Aish’s body-worn camera.  Evidence was also presented that  Aish had a follow up phone conversation with Officer Fetrow before the end of his shift that night, which was  not recorded.  The testimony of Aish indicated that he apologized about “dumping” the situation back to Fridley  but explained that he was feeling like there was a target on his back and he was not comfortable with his not  knowing the Fridley streets like the Fridley officers did.   Within an hour and a half of this incident the previously referenced report was written and submitted. The  report indicated it was an assist of another department never referring to the situation as a pursuit. This report  was later reviewed and approved by Columbia Heights Sargent Fischer in which he did not identify any issues  or concerns with the report.   The first identified concern regarding this incident came about by coincidence when Columbia Heights police  captain, Lenny Austin, ran into Sergeant Kevin Titus, of the Fridley police, who was at the Columbia Heights  6    police department looking for body camera footage of Aish as a follow up the to the report he was writing  regarding the pursuit on the 27th of October.  Austin was not aware of a pursuit that involved his department as  Aish’s report characterized the event as an assist to another police Department.  This sent up a red flag for  Austin and set the investigation in motion. Austin’s initial review of Aish’s report identified a peculiar set of  facts, Fridley reported the event as pursuit but Aish’s report indicated that he was following the suspect at the  pasted speed, it was this incongruous fact that raised a red flag. The ensuing investigation identified the  previously mentioned inconsistency in Aish’s report and several other concerns.   Aish has had a history involving serious issues with honesty to the point where the Anoka County Attorney has  deemed him to be Brady impaired. Brady impairment is a label placed on police officers that have had an  incident of dishonesty in their work history as a police officer.  If a police officer is classified as Brady impaired  the prosecution is required to reveal to the defense the honesty issues associated with the police officer which  can impact that officer’s credibility and thus their effectiveness as a witness if criminal prosecution. The  incident leading to Aish’s Brady impairment designation dates back to 2006 yet the designation as Brady  impaired was not imposed until 2017.   The 2006 incident involved a Minneapolis police officer who had been arrested the night before and had his  service revolver confiscated by the Columbia Heights police.  He returned to the Columbia Heights police  department the following morning to get his gun returned. He was acquainted with Officer Aish through their  Minneapolis Police Academy training course years earlier.  When he arrived to get his gun returned Corporal  Bonesteel informed Aish not to give the Minneapolis officer his revolver if he did not register a 0.0 on the  portable breath test. Aish went outside to administer the portable breath test (BPT) on the officer and then  reported back to Bonesteel that the officer was Ok to drive and that he had blown a .04. A few minutes later he  reported to Captain Lenny Austin that the Minneapolis officer blew a .06.  Bonesteel asked Aish to return to  give him the (BPT). Bonesteel knowing that the device saves the most recent test took a look at the BPT and  discovered that the officer actually blew a.097 exceeding the legal limit to drive and not what Aish had reported  to both him and to the Captain.  The department took action based on this dishonesty and gave Aish a 13 day  7    suspension. However, no determination was made that Aish’s dishonesty warranted the designation of Brady  impaired.    The Brady impairment designation came about in 2017 when a Public Defender, responding to concerns  expressed by his client, regarding the treatment he received form Mr. Aish when he was arrested prompted the  Public Defender to request a look at Mr. Aish’s Disciplinary file. It was the Public Defender, upon discovering  the 2006 incident of dishonesty, sought to have a Brady impairment designation applied to Mr. Aish.  The  Anoka County Attorney reviewed the claim and determined that Aish was indeed Brady impaired as a result of  the 2006 infraction.    The city was at that point of trying to determine if Mr. Aish could still effectively continue with the Columbia  Heights police force or would this impairment make him effectively useless when testifying for the prosecution.  The City decided not to terminate Mr. Aish but rather imposed a specific order directing his performance going  forward. On May 31, 2017 the city imposed upon Mr. Aish the following order:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.      It was this order, going forward, that would govern how Officer Aish would go about performing his  work as a Columbia Heights Police Officer and it was the Cities determination that Aish’s lack of  compliance with this order that led in large part  to the City’s decision to terminate Officer Aish.  As a result of the concerns raised by Aish’s reporting of this incident the department conducted an audit  of Aish’s reporting for the months leading up to this event and determined that there had been two  additional reporting inconsistencies by Aish in violation of Columbia Heights policies.  Both involved  8    domestic situations, one on September 5, 2019 and once on September 9, 2019, in which the city claims,  per policy, written reports were required for but Aish only documented the situations with notes entered  into the CAD.    On July 12, of 2017, less than 2 months from the date this order was imposed, the grievant received a  written warning, in part, for failing to comply with the May 31, 2017 written order relating to activating  body-worn camera.  This event involved a domestic dispute in which Mr. Aish either failed to activate the  camera when gathering information from a domestic abuse complainant or failed to properly label his  body-worn camera video evidence so it would be properly retained and could be used by the prosecution  at a later date. The written reprimand imposed also included a warning to Aish that “Further violations of  these or other policies could lead to more severe discipline including written reprimand, suspension or  termination.”    RELEVANT POLICIES  101:13 Knowledge Policies, Procedures, Statutes and Ordinances  Whether on duty or off duty, all employees shall establish and maintain a working knowledge of  departmental and divisional policies and procedures, and the relevant statutes and ordinances where  applicable.

The critique will be done and applicable  reports submitted for administrative uses, identification of training needs, and/or policy modification.     EMPLOYER’S ARGUMENT  11    The grievant has a history of deceptive and untruthful behavior that has clearly been documented in the  past and was clearly evident in the events leading to this termination.  The evidence identifying the  grievant’s untruthfulness in this case cannot be refuted as it was collected from unbiased officer worn- body cameras, Squad car videos, and computer generated data from squad on board computers. This  information is reinforced by direct testimony of witnesses and indisputable common sense. The grievant’s  past dishonesty requires no more evidence than the unequivocal fact that he was determined to be Brady  Impaired by the Anoka County Attorney’s office in 2017.  The designation of Brady Impairment is  applied when a police officer has been proven to have engaged in acts of dishonesty and thus their status  of Brady impaired must be identified to criminal defense attorneys  enabling an attack on the credibility  of that officers testimony.     Officer Aish was disciplined in 2006, receiving a 13 day suspension, for lying to both his supervisor and  to the Captain of the Columbia Heights Police Department regarding a breathalyzer test he performed on  a fellow officer from the Minneapolis Police Department. He was told not to return a confiscated service  revolver to that officer if the officer failed the breathalyzer test. Aish reported back to his supervisor that  the officer was .04 and reported to the Captain that he was .06 but in actuality the test results were a .097  which clearly would not warrant return of the revolver. The PBT (Portable Breathalyzer Test) stored the  most recent test conducted and it was from that that Aish was caught being untruthful to his superiors.    The Brady label was not applied in 2006 however, but rather came about serendipitously when a public  defender requested Aish’s disciplinary file in response to concerns that defense had regarding the way  Aish had treated their client. It was that inquiry that the brought Aish’s 2006 discipline into focus and  resulted in the Anoka County Attorney’s determination that Aish was Brady impaired.   The Columbia Heights Police Department at that point had to determine what the impact would be on the  department as a result of this Brady determination and could Aish continue to work for the department.   12    The City decided not to terminate Aish, but rather attempted to deal with the very serious credibility issue  Aish now presented by imposing the following order:   Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  Further instances involving untruthfulness or ethical violations; failure  to follow the order stated above or failure to follow departmental general  orders or directives could result in disciplinary action up to and  including termination.    The department viewed this order as critical for Aish’s continued employment and that this order was in  effect a “Last Chance Agreement” for Mr. Aish.     Aish’s clear violation of this order and his dishonesty was readily evidenced through an investigation that  included a review of Aish’s body-worn camera, Fridley officer’s body camera, Fridley squad cameras, on  board computers, and dispatch recordings. This data revealed that Mr. Aish, turned off his body camera  while continuing to discuss the pursuit with Fridley officers and in three different places in his subsequent  reporting of the event revealed that he intentionally misrepresented the facts of the pursuit in an effort to  diminish the severity of the event and his involvement. The reason he did this was to justify reporting it as  an “Assist to another police department” rather than properly reporting the events as a pursuit which it  certainly was under Columbia Heights policy and state law.  By minimizing the event and documenting it  as an “Assist to another Department” it would severely diminish the scrutiny the report would be subject  to by leadership in the Columbia Height Police Department.   Following are three excerpts taken from Aish’s report which are irrefutable misrepresentations of the  actual facts:   1) As the Suspect passed one Fridley squad pulled over at the Home Depot the suspect began to accelerate  again. He had been failing to pull over for my emergency lights and sirens for several blocks now, I had  been directly behind him. At this point I advised dispatch I was not going to continue and pulled over and  13    let the Fridley squads take over. I observed as the driver continued to accelerate northbound on Main  Street as he approached the stop sign at 57th Ave. I observed the suspect blow through the stop sign and  intersection without making any attempt to slow or stop (Emphasis added).    The camera squad video from Fridley officer Bulman’s car clearly shows that Aish did not pull over prior to the  suspect blowing through the stop sign at 57th Ave. rather the video is clear that Aish follows suspect right  through the stop sign and then verbalizes that suspect is picking up speed and then acknowledges that this is  going to be a pursuit and I am getting out.     The second misrepresentation in the report is his incorrect documenting of his speed. Stating:  2) “I continued to follow Fridley squads as they continued to try and get on the suspect to pull over  and stop. I followed at the posted speed limit.” (Emphasis added)    Once again this is not true.  The Fridley squad cars are equipped with a computer GPS system that tracks the  speed of the vehicle and is shown contemporaneously with the squad video which clearly reveals that Bulman’s  vehicle was reaching speeds of 58 miles per hour nearly two time the posted speed limit leading up to the PIT  maneuver.   At the same time the Elasky rear squad video also shows Aish trailing the two Fridley vehicles but  maintaining the same distance behind indicating that his vehicle would have to be traveling at the roughly the  same speed. Finally, the squad video at the scene of the PIT maneuver shows Aish arriving within just a couple  of seconds after Bulman’s car arrives confirming that Aish would have necessarily been traveling at up to 58  miles per hour in order to arrive immediately after the Fridley squads.    Aish does not contradict this undeniable video evidence rather concludes that he was mistaken.  He said he was  so focused on the work at hand that he did not look down to track his speed and it just felt like they were  moving at a slow pace. Frist, officers are trained to keep tract of this type of information and an officer of 20  years should certainly be able to track his speed in this situation.  In fact if, as he claimed, this was a very slow  following there was nothing that should have been that adrenalin producing that should have so effected his  ability to recognize or tract the speed at which he was traveling.  In addition, if he was not sure of his speed he  should not be claiming he was traveling at the posted speed limit he should have explained that he was not sure.  14    In addition Aish testified that he was not sure exactly what the speed limit was on the streets he was traveling.   Also, his claim defies common sense.  We all have driven automobiles and we all can tell when we are traveling  at a high rate of speed. Without tracking his speed he should certainly have known he was not moving at the  posted speed. His claim does not seem like a mistake rather an intentional misrepresentation.    The third misrepresentation in his report is that he stated:  3) I turned northbound on Starlight and observed the Fridley Officers PIT the Suspect vehicle.   The Fridley officers were successful with the PIT and stopped the suspect at Starlight and  Trinity. I activated my emergency lights and assisted taking the suspect into custody  (Emphasis added).    Once again the misrepresentation of the timing of Aish activating his emergency lights is also captured  on Fridley squad video.  While Aish claimed he did not activate his emergency lights until he arrived at  the scene, after the PIT was completed, the Fridley squad rear camera video irrefutably proves  otherwise.  Rear camera video from Elasky’s squad shows that after the Fridley squads passed Aish’s  squad which had been pulled over to the curb Aish then pulls away from the curb immediately after the  Fridley squads pass him.  The video also clearly shows that Aish activates his emergency lights shortly  after pulling out which was well before the PIT occurred as documented by Aish.    All three of these misrepresentations tend to downplay the seriousness of the event, the role in which  Aish played in this process and the likelihood his portrayal of the facts would lead anyone to believe  that he had been involved in a pursuit.  Aish does not document the event as a pursuit and rather drafts a  report labeling it as an “Assist” to another department to ensure the lower level of scrutiny by his  supervisors.  Originally, Aish’s plan would have worked for him and the report would have gone  unchallenged had it not been for the purely coincidental encounter between Chief Lenny Austin had  with Fridley Police Sargent Titus when the two bumped into each other at the Columbia Heights police  department in which Titus explained that he was seeking documentation of a pursuit. Austin found it  troubling to hear that there was a Pursuit involving his department and he had not been made aware of  15    the “Pursuit.”  It was only a result of this chance encounter that prompted the ensuing investigation of  Aish leading ultimately his termination.      The Columbia Heights policies very clearly defines “Pursuit”  Columbia Heights policy  603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.   All of the elements of the policy have been met under the facts laid out. The Union however claimed that  these facts failed to establish a pursuit. The union argues first that this was merely a failure to stop not a  felony fleeing as the suspect never acknowledged or made any gesture indicating he was aware of Aish’s  presence. Without such awareness by the suspect the Union concludes that this was not fleeing thus there  was no violation of law as required by the policy. Neither under the policy nor under state law is there any  requirement that the suspect make some gesture to indicate they know they are being followed.   The state law defines fleeing as follows:   “To increase speed, extinguish motor vehicle headlights or taillights, refuse to stop the  vehicle, or use other means with intent to attempt to elude a peace officer following a  signal given by the peace officer to the driver of a motor vehicle.”    Contrary to the Union’s claim, each element of the State’s definition of “Pursuit” has been met as well as  meeting all the requirements the City’s Pursuit policy. While the objective evidence presented at the hearing  clearly shows that a pursuit occurred it is equally clear that Aish’s misrepresentations in his report  intentionally attempts to blur the fact that there was a fleeing.  An element of fleeing is that the driver  “Increases speed” thus Aish misrepresented that he was traveling at the speed limit.  Fleeing also requires  an evasive maneuver by the suspect thus Aish documents that he pulled out of the pursuit before the driver  ran through the stop sign at 57th Ave. thus before the evasive maneuver occurred and that also was not true.  In addition, he failed to document that he was traveling at nearly 2 times the speed limit which is also an  16    evasive maneuver.  Finally he said he did not turn on his emergency lights until he arrived at the scene of  the PIT once the suspect was apprehended. Also not true.  He turned on his lights and kept them on the  entire time he followed the Fridley officers pursuing suspect.  His failure to document accurately as to when  he activated his lights is another dishonest attempt to avoid any conclusion that Aish’s actions met the  Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy which requires activating emergency lights.   While the Union claims the “Violation of the law” requirement in the Columbia Heights “Pursuit” policy  is a requirement to have a fleeing as defined by state law there is no such reference to a fleeing requirement  in the policy. The policy merely requires “Failure to stop as required by law” Minnesota law requires that  vehicles pull over and stop on the side of the road when approached by a police vehicle with its lights and  siren are activated. Minn. Stat. §§ 169.20, subd. 5; 169.011. The suspect did not do this thus his actions are  a pursuit under the Columbia Heights policy, regardless of whether there was a fleeing and thus should  have been reported as a pursuit.    The Pursuit reporting requirement of Columbia Heights policy 603:06 (See below) was also clearly violated  when Aish failed to document the Pursuit according to the policy.  Not only do his actions violate Columbia  Heights policy they also violate Minnesota Statute §626.5531 as all pursuits must be documented with the  state.    Columbia Heights Policy 603:06 Reporting and Review   At the conclusion of any pursuit initiated or participated in, the primary officer in the pursuit  - or if the primary officer is unable to complete the report, the supervisor or senior officer on  duty - must complete a report. This information may be incorporated into any other report  prepared by the primary officer the report shall minimally include: (Emphasis added)  1.    The reason for the pursuit, including specifically what information the officer knew at  the time the pursuit began.   2.  The route of the pursuit as best can be recalled   3.  Traffic conditions, presence and location of citizens.   17    4.  Any violations the driver of the fleeing vehicle committed during the pursuit.   5.   Other Columbia Heights squads involved and any other agencies.   6.  Damage to any vehicle, property, and/or injury to any person.   7.  Supervisor on duty at time of the pursuit.   8.   Road and weather conditions.   9.  Time pursuit began and ended.   10.  How, where, and why the pursuit concluded or was abandoned.   11.   Charges filed, if any.     B.  The primary officer must also complete the Minnesota Pursuit Reporting Form as  required by Statute §626.5531. If the primary officer is unable to complete this form, the form  shall be filled out by the supervisor or senior officer on duty.     C.   The Pursuit will be reviewed and critiqued by a Captain, and will include the  supervisor, and officers involved as soon after the incident as possible. The Captain will submit  a summary of the critique and applicable reports will be forwarded to the Chief of Police. The  critique will be done and applicable reports submitted for administrative uses, identification  of training needs, and/or policy modification.       Aish’s actions were clearly insubordination as he violated a direct order regarding body-worn camera  and phone call recordings. The order states:  Until further notice, you will record all interactions with non- departmental personnel, regardless of how you come in contact with  them, with your department issued body-worn camera while on duty. You  will also record all phone conversations you have with witnesses,  suspects, citizens and non-departmental personnel.  A clear violation of this direct order is easily seen when reviewing Aish’s body-worn camera which  shows Aish turning off his camera once the suspect is apprehended. Other officers at the scene clearly  continue to run their cameras and in fact Aish asks in a low voice to Officer Elasky “Are you on?”   Elasky says “Yes” and apologizes. Further he explains that he has to keep his on. Even with all this  Aish does not activate his camera while continuing to debrief about the event.  A second violation of  18    this order occurs a few hours later as Aish phones Fridley Officer Fetrow, without recording it, and  once again discusses the Pursuit and apologizes for his needing to get out of the pursuit.     In 2017 Aish believed he was going to be terminated as a result of his Brady impairment.  The  Department decided not to terminate but imposed this very clear and very strict order to record outside  interactions.  It was understood that this was a last chance for Aish to keep his job.  Failing to comply,  as indicted in the order, could cause his termination.  He understood that he could be fired for non- compliance but that did not stop him. Aish claims that former Chief Nadeau, prior to retiring, had soften  the adherence to the policy recognizing that under certain situations the recording was not required  when interacting with other departments.  The Union however chose not have Nadeau testify to such  modifications and no written modifications of the order were presented at the hearing.  Beyond that,  here was a situation in which there was a high speed pursuit of a reckless driver in a residential area.   Apprehension of the suspect followed a risky PIT maneuver which was followed by all officers at the  scene, including Aish, pulled out their guns and forcefully removed the suspect from his car.  Under no  circumstances would this have ever led anyone to the conclusion that any follow up debriefing between  the two police departments was the type of interaction that would not need to be captured by Aish under  his 2017 order.     UNION’S ARGUMENT  The employer fails all sense of objectivity when analyzing the facts of this case and only interprets  them only through a lens of a strong predisposition to view the grievant, Mathew Aish, as dishonest  causing the employer to view as a lie any honest explainable mistakes.  Clear evidence of the  employer’s effort to judge all the actions associated with this event in a light most unfavorable to Aish  the employer, without seeking any clarification or confirmation from Officer Elasky, jumped to the  conclusion that when Elasky touched his body-worn camera at the time Aish asked if he were “On” the  employer wrongly concluded that Elasky was book marking this point on his video as it was a  19    suspicious question to be asked. The truth of this action was revealed through Elasky’s testimony at the  hearing revealing that it was an innocent reflex action Elasky had developed regarding his body-worn  camera and in no way was evidence of his concern and his need to bookmark.  Quite the opposite was  the testimony of both Fetrow and Elasky in that they both explained that it is quite common for officers  to ask if another is “On” but not for nefarious reasons but rather to know so they can prevent expressing  themselves in a way they would rather not have captured on video.    Mathew Aish was a police officer in the Columbia Heights police department for over 20 years.  In  2006 he was disciplined for his dishonesty and has learned the hard way from his mistake. Since that  day Aish has never shied away from letting others, especially new officers, hear about his troubles in an  effort to help them learn from his mistake as he has.     This was not a pursuit under the Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy and there was no fleeing with  respect to Officer Aish under the state law.  The employer insists on an interpretation of “fleeing” and “pursuit” that defies logic. The employer  maintains a position as to what is a pursuit that runs completely contrary to the opinions of their  officers, Fridley officers, as well as the opinion of a recognized expert Peter Dahl.   Further, the employer fails to accept the logical interpretation of the facts surrounding the events on  October 27, 2019 and rather insists on labeling these as acts of dishonesty worthy of termination.  The  employer takes this unrelenting position even in light of the expert testimony of Peter Dahl who  provided a reasonable and logical explanation for Aish’s documentation of the events of October 27,  2019 that does not include any acts of dishonesty on Aish’s part. Mr. Dahl is currently an adjunct  instructor at Dakota County Technical College teaching Law Enforcement Customized Training,  including basic and advanced law enforcement including driving involving pursuit and related issues.    Columbia Heights pursuit policy reads as follows:   20    603:01:01 Pursuit  The attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when the emergency lights and siren have been  activated and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Expert witness Dahl carefully reviewed all the evidence including squad video and provided an expert opinion  that within a reasonable degree of police certainty Aish had not participated in a pursuit. Under the policy there  are three required elements.  1) Attempt to stop the vehicle  2) Police squad lights and siren must be on   3) Vehicle fails to stop as required by law.  Dahl testified that the third element, fails to stop as required by law, was not met under these facts.  Dahl  testified that “Under the Law” is clearly a reference to the state law relating to fleeing, Fleeing therefore  requires an attempt by the suspect to “Elude a peace officer” and that was not present.  Aish speeding up to get  in position to follow the suspect is not a pursuit as was confirmed by the testimony of Fridley Officer Fetrow.   A pursuit requires an attempt to elude the officer and that did not occur.  The suspect never acknowledged the  officers presence as per the testimony of Aish who said the driver never looked in rear mirror or in any other  way gave any indication that he knew he was being followed.  He was never focused on the police car behind  him.  Fridley Officers Fetrow and Elasky confirmed this saying they could see the driver’s face as he passed  them on Main Street and testified that he had a “Fixed 1000-yard stare” indicating he in no way was aware of  the police car behind him. Consequently, from the time Aish got behind the suspect there were no eluding  maneuvers or even increased speed to suggest the driver was aware of the police officer much less trying to  elude the peace officer.  Once it appeared as though the suspect became aware of Aish. Officer Aish bowed out  of the process acknowledging the situation stating to dispatch “This is going to be a pursuit, I am getting out.”  Up until this point there was no fleeing therefore no “Violation of the law” thus the elements of Columbia  Heights pursuit policy had not been met according to the expert testimony of Peter Dahl. Dahl continues by  refuting the interpretation provided by the City in which the City claims that it is a violation of the law if a  driver does not pull over for an emergency vehicle.  Dahl explains that the law referenced by the employer was\n"

If not, what is the appropriate Remedy?    INTRODUCTION  Mathew Aish was a police officer in Columbia Heights hired in 1999 and terminated on January 15, 2020.  Law  Enforcement Labor Services responded to the termination by filing a step one grievance on January 27, 2020.  The termination stems primarily from an incident that occurred on October 27, 2019 in which the grievant,  Mathew Aish, responded to a dispatch call regarding a driver operating a vehicle recklessly on city streets in  2    Columbia Heights and Fridley. The description relayed by dispatch was that of a white Taurus driving at speeds  up to 80 miles per hour and traveling north in south bound lanes of traffic.   The concerns raised by the City leading to their decision to terminate revolve around the follow up reporting of  this incident by Mathew Aish including concerns of truthfulness, accuracy and complying with a direct order to  activate body worn camera at all times when engaging with non-departmental personnel. This direct order came  about as a result of a 2006 incident in which Mr. Aish had falsely represented the sobriety test of another police  officer from a neighboring jurisdiction.  Due to the dishonesty involved in that event Mr. Aish was determined,  by the Anoka County Attorney’s Office, to be Brady impaired. As result of this designation the City is  compelled to reveal the issues of Aish’s dishonesty to defense council when Mr. Aish is involved in the  prosecution of a crime.  As a result of the 2006 incident the City imposed a requirement that Mr. Aish activate  his body worn camera whenever interacting with non-departmental personnel in an effort to diminish credibility  questions that would likely arise at subsequent criminal proceedings that involved Mr. Aish testifying on behalf  of the City and to create a process that would enable the City to keep Mr. Aish employed.    An Arbitration hearing was held at the Columbia Heights Police Department offices on August 17 to 19, 2020.    FACTS  Mathew Aish was terminated on January 15, 2020 after 20 plus years of services as a police officer for the city  of Columbia Heights. The incident that is largely the basis for this termination occurred at approximately 2:30  PM that afternoon in which a Columbia Heights Dispatcher announced that there was a driver proceeding  recklessly on the streets of Columbia Heights.

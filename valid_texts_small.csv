By Matt McKinney (https://www.startribune.com/matt-mckinney/6370539/) and PAUL Walsh AUGUST 9, 2011 — 9:59PM A man suspected of shooting someone at a south Minneapolis public housing complex Monday night was confronted and shot minutes later by Minneapolis police, authorities said. As he recovered from a police gunshot at Hennepin County Medical Center, Leroy Martinez, 23, of 1426 Penn Av. N., was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault in connection with a shooting near the playground of the Little Earth of United Tribes public housing complex. Like Martinez, the victim in that shooting is expected to live. The shootings took place around 11:15 p.m., when two off-duty officers working for the housing complex and three on-duty officers heard gunshots near 25th Street and Cedar Avenue S. As they responded to the gunfire, officers saw a man running. The officers ran after him. The accounts of police and an eyewitness interviewed by the Star Tribune differ on what happened next. According to police, Martinez drew his gun, refused orders to drop it and was shot by Minneapolis officer Terry Nutter. Yet Delora Iceman, who lives at Little Earth of United Tribes, said the man had thrown his gun to the ground and held his hands in the air when Nutter shot him, after the officer warned that he would do so. ""He had no reason to shoot that little boy,"" said Iceman, who said she witnessed the scene from her balcony. Minneapolis police spokesman Sgt. Bill Palmer disputed Iceman's account. ""That is not consistent with other statements ... from other independent witnesses,"" he said. Officers Steven Herron, Derek Chauvin and Brandon Brugger and Lt. Gwen Gunter were also at the scene, according to the department. Nutter, Herron, Chauvin and Brugger had been in the area tracking and arresting a fugitive on a felony warrant when they heard the gunshots. Nutter has been a police officer since 2004 and has long worked off-duty at the Little Earth of United Tribes, according to Little Earth president and CEO Bill Ziegler. ""A great officer,"" said Ziegler. ""This is one of the officers that I totally trust."" Ziegler vouched for the officer's actions, as well, saying he spoke to witnesses who told him Martinez drew his weapon. A surveillance video of the shooting exists, according to Ziegler, but the security camera may have been partially obstructed by a tree. A copy of the video was turned over to the Police Department, he said. All of the officers were put on standard three-day administrative leave. Police and the department's internal affairs unit are conducting separate investigations. Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call police at 612-692-TIPS.

KSFY ﬁrst reported this story back in June of 2018 when he was originally arrested. The felony charge of threats of violence was dismissed as well as the two misdemeanor domestic assault charges. He was arrested on Friday, June 15th after he and his wife got into an argument and things escalated from there. According to court documents, the incident happened at the couple's home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The children left the house during the argument to call police. That's when Bruns and his wife got into another argument. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, where you could hear him unlocking a gun safe and hear his wife yelling to put the gun down because she did not want to die. His wife read a statement in the sentencing hearing on Tuesday. She released this statement to KSFY afterwards, ""I do not wish to speak to the media at this time, as I believe the recording and my statement speak for themselves. I am happy justice was served as much as it can be, and look forward to being able to sleep for the next 2 years. I hope my story will give hope to someone else living in fear at this time to come forward and seek help. And for all the women that the system has failed, I hope my story creates change."" At the time of the arrest, Bruns was a police oﬃcer with the Adrian Police Department, but Chief Shawn Langseth told KSFY News he was placed on administrative leave indeﬁnitely.

Adrian Police Chief Shawn Langseth tells KSFY News 43-year-old Richard David Bruns is on administrative leave indeﬁnitely, effective immediately. According to court documents, the incident happened Friday night at the couple's home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The victim told authorities she had three beers and Bruns had eight. She said Bruns was allegedly ""snippy"" with her and their two children when they arrived home, and an argument started. Bruns was ""raging mad"" when he got into the house and asked his wife and 12-year-old son to ﬁght him. The son ""smarted off"" to Bruns and ran outside. Bruns followed, and his wife said she then heard a loud noise outside on the porch. Then she heard he son crying. When she ran to her son, Bruns allegedly began pushing her away with his stomach or chest. The couple's daughter then came into the room, and the victim told her to run across the street to her grandmother's house and call 911. After the children left, Bruns and his wife got into another argument about calling the police. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, according to court documents. Bruns then allegedly used keys to unlock a gun safe. His wife could be heard yelling at him to put the gun down and get it away from her on the recordning. He allegedly told her, ""Cops come knocking on my door, you’re dead,"" and that if he was going to go to jail, he was going to ""earn it."" She pleaded with him and said she did not want to die. Bruns was then heard on the recording locking the gun safe. According to court documents, Bruns admitted to police that he and his wife had been having issues for a long time and said he had gone to far during the incident. He told police he did not think he pointed a gun at his wife. Authorities seized multiple ﬁrearms from the home, including handguns, a riﬂe and a shotgun. They also found a lock-box style gun safe with two handguns and two loaded magazines inside of it. The 12-year-old son told police that Bruns never touched him. Authorities arrested Bruns on second degree assault with a dangerous weapon, intent to terrorize and two counts of domestic assault (a misdemeanor). He was released from Nobles County Jail after posting a $100,000 bond with several conditions, including no contact with the victims. The Compass Center for victims of domestic violence in Sioux Falls says members of law enforcement are not immune from abusive relationships. ""When the perpetrator is someone in law enforcement it makes it much more difﬁcult for a survivor to tell their story,"" The Compass Center Director Michelle Markgraf said. ""The person that they report to is often the friend of the perpetrator and it is sometimes difﬁcult for them to tell their friends that this is going on."" Markgraf said if someone is afraid to report abuse directly to law enforcement, the Compass Center can help. Give them a call at (605) 339-0116 if you are experiencing abuse or fear for the safety of you or your family.

"The hits keep coming  Monday, February 26, 2007 at 10:59 a.m.   By G.R. Anderson Jr.   Friday's Minneapolis City Council meeting brought two different payouts over one alleged police misconduct  incident. The full council approved a $10,000 payday to Christopher D. Perry and $5,000 to his brother Mario  P. Perry, who was a juvenile when the two ran afoul of the cops on November 16, 2004.  Payouts over claims of police misconduct are nothing new in this town (see ""The Hit Parade Revisited,"" CP  7/20/2005), but this incident seemed rooted in some rather, uh, dubious behavior. According to a city attorney's  memo urging the council to approve settlement, MPD officers James Burns and Michael Geere were cruising  the north side looking for ""an identified murder suspect known to frequent"" 4050 Bryant Avenue North. The  officers found a car ""with four occupants"" illegally parked in the alley behind the address. Officer Burns  approached the car and ""smelled marijuana and saw a 'philly blunt' in the ashtray,"" according to the memo from  the city attorney's office.  From there various high jinks ensued, and accounts predictably differ, but someone on the scene was arrested  after allegedly wielding a tire iron, insults were hurled, and at some point the Perry brothers resisted arrest. One  thing all parties agree on is that force was used by the police officers. As a result, both brothers ""received  various scrapes and bruises,"" and Chris Perry suffered a broken tooth, according to the account from the city  attorney's office, which is no doubt vague on some details.  The Perry payouts are the third and fourth police-related settlements so far this year, bringing a grand total of  32,000 taxpayer dollars doled out to save the hides of the men in blue in a court of law. Though the number of  payouts hit a high in 2004, with some 24 settlements paying out more than $2 million, last year the city forked  over only $633,250 over 10 alleged MPD misconduct incidents. Still, payouts over use of force and other  allegations against the police likely won't go away soon. ""It's a total crapshoot,"" says one city hall insider.  ""There is no predictable trend year to year.""  The Perry situation mostly went up in smoke: An obstruction charge against Chris was dismissed, and Mario  was never charged with any crime. ""This was a totally unnecessary incident, but they got hurt,"" says Al Goins,  attorney for the Perry brothers, adding that the settlement was ""small potatoes."" ""The city got a look at these  kids, decided their records were clean and that they were going to present well in a trial, so they settled. The  main issue is whether the city is going to get serious about reigning in its department over use of force."""

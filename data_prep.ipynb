He ripped Luis Garcia’s 5-foot-5, 125-pound body from the car and dropped him face down on the concrete. Garcia remembers feeling blows to his face before he lost consciousness. Three years later, when the Minneapolis Police Department was investigating the events of that night in December 2013, his sister Miriam Garcia said she heard loud noises like “someone hitting something metal.” She got out of the car she was waiting in to find her little brother motionless on the pavement, blood pooling beneath his face as five or six cops stood around him. “Luis, just get up!” she screamed. “Stop playing. You’re scaring me.” She tried to get closer, but an officer cut her off, saying “That’s enough. Shut the f**k up. Just get back in the car.” The next thing Luis Garcia remembers is feeling excruciating pain as an unfamiliar voice commanded him to get up. He was placed back in the squad car, dizzy and his mouth so full of blood he couldn’t speak. Garcia’s account can be found in the 26-page investigative report of the incident, one of 195 police disciplinary files obtained by the Reformer through lengthy and ongoing freedom-of-information litigation with the city of Minneapolis. By\\xa0 Max Nesterak | Tony Webster  - December 15, 2020 Illustration by Rob Dobi for Minnesota Reformer. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 2/24 The officer remembers the incident differently. Lehner told investigators Garcia was just “bleeding from his lip a little bit” and “was talking with us just fine” as they drove him in their squad car to the emergency room, according to the disciplinary file. Doctors would find he had a broken jaw, several facial fractures and two missing front teeth. It was a tragic outcome for a traffic stop that turned up no serious crimes. Garcia had been riding home from a house party with his sister and a couple of friends when they were pulled over for appearing to speed up toward a police officer crossing the road. The driver would testify he didn’t know the dark shape in the street was a police officer and revved his engine because his car horn was broken. Police caught up to him six blocks away and arrested him at gunpoint. Lehner and his partner didn’t arrive on the scene until after another officer had radioed in “code four,” meaning everything was under control, and left. Garcia, who was sitting in the back seat, had a few drinks that night and got mouthy with police. “They kept asking me for identification, when I told them I didn’t have one. I told them I can give you my information. So I talked back like, ‘I don’t have an ID, but I’m not a f**king criminal. Why are you treating us like criminals?’” Garcia said in an interview with the Reformer. Officers handcuffed him, searched him and put him in the back of a squad car. Garcia started kicking the back partition in frustration. Lehner, who declined to comment through his lawyer, would later tell investigators he opened the back door because he was worried Garcia would hurt himself. Then, according to Lehner’s account, Garcia aimed a kick at him and Lehner reacted with a defensive kick meant for his chest but which hit Garcia in the face. When investigators interviewed the five other officers on the scene, none of them said they saw Lehner’s kick, not even Lehner’s partner who was going through Garcia’s possessions on the trunk of the squad car. When police dropped Garcia off at the hospital, Lehner’s partner Steve Wuorinen told the nurse that Garcia fell and “his face hit concrete,” according Wuorin to Hennepin County Medical Center records. Years later, Wuorinen and Lehner would offer up the theory that the Wuorin handcuffed Garcia could have knocked his own teeth out when he was thrashing in the back of the squad car. “I believe he did it when he was banging his head in the car,” Lehner told investigators in 2017, according to the disciplinary file. “There is no way you can convince me that a front push-kick, even to someone’s face, can kick their teeth out.” 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 3/24 Lehner was speaking from some experience, having previously been disciplined for excessive force including at least one instance of kicking a suspect. But there’s no video evidence to corroborate Lehner’s story. He had a dash camera, but he didn’t turn it on when he confronted Garcia. When investigators pressed Lehner on his theory — that Garcia knocked his own teeth out — he told them: “I said what I did and I said where I hit him. Do you know how easy it could have been for me because I knew it was not on the video just to lie?” … Medaria Arradondo, then-Deputy Police Chief, speaks with people outside of the 4th Precinct Police Station after 5 people were shot at a Black Lives Matters protest November 24, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images. THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT is notoriously ineffective at removing bad cops from its ranks. Numerous lawsuits, independent investigations and the disciplinary files obtained by the Reformer show a pattern of mismanagement when it comes to holding officers accountable. Department leaders are routinely blind to numerous warning signs that problem officers pose a danger to the public. Managers are often unaware their subordinates are being investigated for misconduct, promoting them through their ranks and lauding them for their aggressive tactics even as complaints pile up. Only when officers commit the most egregious acts of abuse — like Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd’s neck until he died, or Mohamed Noor fatally shooting Justine Damond when she called 911 for help — are they removed from the force. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 4/24 City data on police misconduct is often disorganized and contradictory. The city’s website says there are 301 open cases alleging misconduct by Minneapolis police officers, although a spreadsheet obtained from the city and dated earlier this month showed there are 242 open complaints against 176 officers. The Civil Rights Department, Police Department, and city communications office did not provide an explanation for these discrepancies. Many of these complaints may very well turn out to be illegitimate once they’re investigated. Most will not result in discipline. Just 2.7% of complaints of police misconduct have resulted in disciplinary action between 2013 and 2019. But if the past is any guide, cases of egregious misconduct are also among them. A Flourish data visualization Even as successive mayors and police chiefs have promised transparency and reform, the department has maintained its staunch resistance to outside oversight. It obfuscates and delays information requests from City Council members, civilian oversight committees and journalists, and disciplines officers who speak to the press with the swiftness that police reform advocates wish they would impose on officers who brutalize citizens. About six months before Floyd’s death, a Reformer contributor filed a public records request for all disciplinary records of the city’s roughly 800 officers, which are public under state law. But it took a lawsuit for the city to provide even a single document. Although the 195 files eventually provided by the city are just a fraction of the disciplinary incidents, they show a department that is slow to address accusations of abuse, often taking years to mete out a letter of reprimand or week’s suspension without retraining or other corrective actions. The documents detail officers failing to report beating suspects, fighting in bars, yelling racial slurs and sexually harassing domestic abuse victims. There’s Officer Heather Sterzinger, who in 2012 roused a woman who had passed out in the atrium of her own apartment building with a pressure point maneuver, according to disciplinary documents. Sterzinger allegedly kneeled on the woman’s back until she couldn’t breathe and then dragged her out by her handcuffs. Sterzinger then pulled down the woman’s dress so one of her breasts was exposed as she was put into the back of a squad car and laughed when the woman asked her dress to be pulled up, according to the documents. Sterzinger never reported her use of force — nor did her partner. The department only investigated after the woman filed a complaint. A year and a half later, Sterzinger was suspended for 10 hours. She is now a sergeant and is also accused in an ongoing lawsuit against the city for creating a hostile work environment for a Japanese-American officer. Then there’s Officer Tyrone Barze, who while working off-duty at a Minneapolis bar in 2014 sprayed the bar manager in the face at close range with a “party can” of chemical irritant intended for crowd control and effective 18-20 feet away, according to department records. The spray hit several other people standing outside the bar. He allegedly told the bar 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 5/24 manager that he would arrest him if he didn’t pay him for his off-duty shift. Nearly three years after the incident, the case was resolved: Barze was suspended for 10 hours and prohibited from working off-duty at places that sell alcohol for 90 days. He is now a sergeant. And there’s Officers Peter Brazeau and Alexander Brown, who in 2016 both punched a handcuffed drunk man in the face, breaking his nose and possibly causing a traumatic brain injury, discipline documents say. The officers also put a spit hood over his face and then an EMT injected him with ketamine; doctors had to intubate him to keep him breathing, according to arbitration documents. When asked at a disciplinary proceeding, Brazeau said he wouldn’t do anything differently. More than two years after the incident, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo fired both the officers. But in the intervening years, they were promoted to training officers, a “mitigating factor” cited by the arbitrator in deciding to overturn their terminations. Brazeau is currently an officer; Brown’s status is unclear. Most people who put on a uniform and head out to patrol do not violate people’s civil rights. “We have 3 to 6% of cops who shouldn’t be cops,” then-Deputy Chief Art Knight said in January — that’s about 25 to 50 officers, based on the size of the department at the time. “We have some members on this department who shouldn’t be here, but the vast majority of them should be here,” Knight said. (Knight was demoted from deputy chief later this year after another instance of being too frank, when he warned that unless the department changed its recruiting practices, it would wind up with “the same old white boys.”) But failing to discipline and terminate problem officers is also a systemic problem in the police department that endangers residents, especially those who are Black, Native and Latino. It forces the city to pay out large settlements and squanders any goodwill earned by good cops. “I don’t think you can work around them. There’s too many opportunities for it to go bad,” said Lucy Gerold, a former Minneapolis Police Department Commander, about problem officers. What we don’t see from the department’s disciplinary files are the part of the iceberg submerged underwater. Only the small percentage of complaints which result in discipline may be viewed by the public under Minnesota’s public records laws. Everything else is kept a secret. The disciplinary records obtained by the Reformer also reveal a pattern in the department of relying on victims or members of the public to file a complaint before it investigates misconduct. Because officers reliably protect one another and fail to report misconduct by their colleagues, that points to an unknown number of abuses, which may only come to light in court. For example, years before Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyd’s neck, he allegedly hit a 14-year-old boy twice with a flashlight and kneeled on his back as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe — but Chauvin’s public file doesn’t include that use of force. The details only became known through an 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 6/24 investigation by the state attorney general, who is prosecuting Chauvin for murder. Since the killing of Floyd, Minneapolis has found itself in a familiar position: apologizing for abuse by one of its officers while blaming forces beyond its control and also promising transformational change. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Arradondo have rolled out a steady stream of reforms for months — some with teeth, some just “shallow remixes of previous reforms” as one council member described them. But they often say their hands are tied, blaming the Minneapolis Police Federation and its arbitration process as the biggest barriers to ridding the department of bad cops, neither of which can be changed without the state Legislature. Gerold disagrees. “There’s been too much put on the union as excuse making,” Gerold said. “People are not willing to look at leadership. And I think it boils down a lot to leadership.” Indeed, the presence of a strong union and arbitration process do not explain why the department is so slow to investigate abuses and make disciplinary decisions. Over the past decade, the department has spent 539 days on average resolving a case from the time it’s opened, according to the disciplinary files reviewed by the Reformer. They also do not explain why department leaders routinely sign off on glowing performance reviews for problem officers, which later bolsters their defense in arbitration. And they don’t explain why the department has reinforced the warrior cop culture by bestowing officers with awards for aggressive tactics which would later put them before a disciplinary panel. The city declined to make Arradondo available for an interview and did not respond to a list of written questions. … 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 7/24 A Minneapolis Police canine unit responded to a call at a convenience store on Nicollet Avenue on March 10, 1998.

OFFICER BLAYNE LEHNER’S only stated work experience when he was hired as a Minneapolis police officer in 1998 was milking cows on a farm in central Minnesota. He had just earned an associate’s degree in law enforcement from Hibbing Community College, where his extracurriculars included martial arts and the law enforcement drill team. He applied to the department in February and was earning $15.25 an hour on the force by December. Lehner was coming onto the department during a period of continued expansion of policing in America. Through the 1980s, the federal government began defunding mental health and other welfare programs, while beefing up local police and equipping them with military training and equipment to fight the “war on drugs.” In 1994, Congress passed the “Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act,” or so-called “Crime Bill,” championed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, approved by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton. Along with funding for 100,000 new police officers, the law ramped up the war on drugs and raised penalties for dozens of offenses. Violent crime was spiking in Minneapolis through the mid-90s, as it was in many other American cities. Grim marketing branded the city as a particularly deadly hellhole: In 1995, a gun store owner in south Minneapolis printed T-shirts reading “Murderapolis, City of Wakes” during a legal fight over zoning with the city. The shirts soon caught the attention of a New York Times writer, giving Minneapolis national notoriety for gun violence. Nowhere was this moniker 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 8/24 so potent as in the Twin Cities and the surrounding suburbs. Two months after the Times story ran, then-Gov. Arne Carlson sent state troopers and helicopters into Minneapolis without warning local officials. “This is a clear case where perception is reality,” he said at the time, warning that Minneapolis’ bad reputation was bad for business. Even as violence dropped through the rest of the decade — following the downward trend nationwide — being unconditionally “tough on crime” was a prerequisite for getting elected.  Police, meanwhile, were increasingly called upon to treat the symptoms of broader social problems like mental illness. In pop culture, too, police were the foot soldiers in the war against America’s social ills: addiction, gun violence and gangs. The television show “COPS” launched on the eve of the ’90s, glorifying the police’s hand-to-hand combat against the collapse of law and order. The Minneapolis Police Department was featured in an early season right before the show went to primetime. COPS only came to an end in the U.S. after Floyd was killed, with Minneapolis bookending one of the longest running TV shows. The show has since resumed production but will reportedly not air in the United States. Through the ’90s and 2000s the Minneapolis Police Department trained its officers to be “warrior cops,” formally with courses like “Weapons of Mass Destruction,” and informally on the streets. Discipline documents reveal that when Chauvin was still a recruit in 2002, he helped arrest three Black men suspected of burglary. One of the men started swearing at Chauvin, so the senior officer, Bill Palmer, hit the brakes, causing one suspect to slam his head into the back of the partition. The man was treated at the hospital and then released after they learned he wasn’t involved in the burglary. Palmer was sent to an anger management evaluation and told he would be suspended for 20 hours if he had any more violations. This was Chauvin’s on-the-job training. In 1998, Human Rights Watch published a report on police brutality in Minneapolis and about a dozen other cities several months before Lehner joined the force. It reads like it could have been published yesterday: “Officers who repeatedly commit human rights violations tend to be a small minority who taint entire police departments but are protected, routinely, by the silence of their fellow officers and by flawed systems of reporting, oversight, and accountability.” The report details cases like those found in the Minneapolis Police Department’s disciplinary records two decades later. Like Michael Lardy and Marvin Schumer, who in 1993 allegedly handcuffed two intoxicated Native American men, stuffed them in the trunk of their 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 9/24 squad car, and drove erratically to knock them around. Even after the city paid out $100,000 to each victim, the cops stayed on the force. The Humans Rights Watch report also details the case of Lt. Mike Sauro, whose name is still invoked to this day when talking about police brutality. Sauro was promoted through the ranks while dozens of complaints of excessive force failed to stick to his record. That included a botched raid Sauro led in 1989, which killed an elderly Black couple when the officers’ flash bang grenade set fire to their house. He cost the city a then-record setting $1 million for kicking and beating a handcuffed college student in the back of a bar while working off duty on New Year’s Eve in 1990. Local and federal prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges, believing a jury wouldn’t convict. But the victim, Craig Mische, brought a civil lawsuit that went to trial. One of many damning details that emerged was that the police department reportedly did not investigate Mische’s complaint because they believed it could hurt the city’s defense in a civil trial. The jury ruled in Mische’s favor and put forth a striking condemnation — not just of Sauro, but of the entire Minneapolis Police Department. They found the city liable for “maintaining a custom of deliberate indifference to complaints about excessive force in the department.” After another incident, the police chief tried to fire Sauro for a second time in 1996 calling him “incompetent, unprofessional and inappropriate, at best. At worst it constituted criminal assault,” according to the Star Tribune. An arbitrator overturned the termination, and like Frey and Arradondo, Chief Robert Olson said the arbitration system was possibly the biggest impediment to accountability. For all the bluster, however, the police department also rewarded Sauro repeatedly. Sauro stayed on the force until 2016. He went on to lead the sex crimes unit, which a Star Tribune investigation found to be alarmingly ineffective in catching, arresting and convicting sexual assault suspects, while at times showing indifference to victims. This is the police department — at once celebrated and attacked for its aggressive tactics — that attracted cops like Lehner and Chauvin. And as they rose through the ranks, they were rewarded for using those same aggressive tactics. The city of Minneapolis faces the same conundrum now. Officers like Lehner and Chauvin — stewed in this culture — went on to perpetuate it, with Lehner serving as a leader in the union and Chauvin as a seasoned training officer. … 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 10/24 A bystander captured video of Minneapolis Police Officer Blayne Lehner appearing to choke a protester in 2012. IT’S UNCLEAR what kind of officer Lehner was at first. The city of Minneapolis provided the Reformer his personnel file, which includes his high school transcripts, application and résumé. But it doesn’t have any unredacted notes of concern or praise for seven years. By 2013, though, there were plenty of warning signs that Lehner was at risk of using excessive force like the kick that would break Luis Garcia’s face. Lehner was named in two federal lawsuits against the city of Minneapolis for excessive force and seen in media reports choking and macing protesters. Within the span of one month in 2012, Lehner was found to have used excessive force three times, including at least one incident in which he kicked a suspect. It’s unclear what sanction was imposed, however, because the city has refused to provide public records for six other incidents in which Lehner was disciplined. The department doesn’t appear to have taken any action to prevent Lehner from kicking future suspects in the face, like the handcuffed Garcia. He wasn’t reassigned or taken off the street, either. To the contrary: Even if his undisciplined use of force was a massive liability, Lehner’s aggressive style was repeatedly praised and rewarded by his colleagues. Around this time, he was elected to a leadership position in the union. In July 2013, Lehner was named 5th Precinct Officer of the Month. In nominating him, his supervisors noted: “He is looked at as a shift leader by the younger Officers on the shift and produces great numbers every month.” The department appeared to have embraced a tradeoff: a few civil rights violations in return for good stats. “Minneapolis in particular has struggled with the tension that every police department has, which is between rewarding the aggressive officers who are out there stopping crime and making sure that police aggression doesn’t cross the constitutional line,” said Eric Hageman, an attorney who represented Garcia in his case against the city. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 11/24 Two months before he would break Garcia’s jaw, Lehner received an “Award of Merit” for tackling an armed suspect and putting him in a chokehold. The city would later ban all chokeholds and neck restraints shortly after Floyd’s death as part of an agreement with the state’s Department of Human Rights, which is currently investigating the Minneapolis Police Department for systemic discriminatory practices against people of color. … THE CLEAREST PATTERN to emerge when examining the disciplinary files is that when a Minneapolis police officer does something wrong, no matter how big or small, other officers on the scene will minimize what happened or report not having seen or heard anything. Just like when Lehner kicked Garcia in the face and the five officers on the scene said they saw nothing, in file after file, officers tell investigators they didn’t see anything. In 2014, a Minneapolis police officer suggested a group of six young East African men were members of Al-Qaeda and called one a “piece of s**t” during an expletive-laced pat down, according to discipline documents. Three witnesses heard it and filed complaints against the officer, including then- Minneapolis Park Board Superintendent Jayne Miller, who was doing a ridealong with Park Police at the time. The officer, Christopher Guelcher, admitted to making a comment about Al-Qaeda and using profanity, but the three other officers on the scene told investigators they didn’t hear a reference to Al-Qaeda. The Office of Police Conduct Review finished its investigation a year after the incident. A year after that, the department issued its discipline recommendation: training related to “Somalian culture” and a suspension, which three years later the union negotiated down to 15 hours. By the time the discipline file was closed — almost five years after the incident — the officer had already been retired for about two years. In another incident in 2014, Officer John Haugland yelled “Get on the f***ing ground,” “I’m gonna f***in kill you” multiple times to a man seen running after hearing gunshots, discipline documents say. After the man was handcuffed, reports say Haugland’s partner Troy Carlson said the man seemed to move suddenly, so Carlson hit him in the head, causing him to fall to the pavement. There were six other officers on the scene; two said they saw Carlson hit the suspect. Both those officers appeared on the squad camera footage, which they reviewed before reporting they had seen Carlson use force. One said it looked like Carlson was trying to push the subject into the back of the squad car. The other said he thought Carlson smacked him in the head to get the suspect’s attention. The victim was let go and not charged with a crime. Carlson was disciplined a year and a half later, although it took nearly three years for the case to be settled after the union appealed. He got a 40-hour suspension, by which time he had been promoted to sergeant. His partner 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 12/24 Haugland was issued a letter of reprimand for swearing nearly two years after the incident. Under new police guidelines created this summer, threatening to use force is considered a use of force. Haugland and Carlson are now both sergeants. In the warrior cop ethos, officers have to protect each other from all danger including unfair censure from Internal Affairs, civilian oversight panels, politicians and the press, who just don’t understand the job. “When I’m on the street and I’m in uniform, everybody’s got to have my back because I could be the next one at the end of someone’s gun,” said Gerold, the retired police commander. “And there’s something that starts to happen that crosses the line into not telling the truth … It’s a problem, and I don’t have a good answer for it.” The blue wall of silence also extends to some sergeants and lieutenants, members of the same union as the rank-and-file but whom they are supposed to be holding accountable. For example, Sgt. Richard Altonen arrived on the scene where Lehner kicked Garcia to review the use of force. Altonen, a former Internal Affairs investigator, didn’t report seeing anything concerning despite the bloodied teenager. In 2002, then-Sgt. Bob Kroll, now president of the police union, failed to report for nearly two weeks that an officer under his supervision drunkenly fired his weapon over the head of another officer at a shift party. Kroll was demoted for 90 days, according to discipline documents. The city did not provide the investigatory file related to this incident, and it’s unclear if it was challenged by the union. In another case from 2015, a police officer hit a fleeing suspect with his squad car. The officer reported his use of force to his supervisor, Sgt. Christie Nelson. But in her report, Nelson wrote that the suspect tripped on his untied shoes, hit a tree and ricocheted onto the squad car. A complaint was filed against Nelson. That set in motion a nearly two-year- long investigation, despite a camera in the squad car capturing the conversation Nelson had with her subordinate, in which he told her he hit the suspect with his car. There is also footage of the arrest captured on a dash cam — footage that Nelson did not review before advancing the theory that the suspect fell out of his shoes, according to disciplinary documents. Nelson was ultimately suspended for 10 hours without pay. Nelson is now a lieutenant. The blue wall of silence is paradoxical: Police rely on truth-telling witnesses to solve crimes, but they adhere to rigid omertà when it comes to their own. And most rank-and-file officers don’t like dealing with bad cops. ”Good cops want good discipline,” said Gerold, the retired police commander. “They don’t like officers getting away with bullsh**t.” 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 13/24 The most effective inoculation against the blue wall of silence has been body cameras. “Having video footage changes the game. We’ve seen that over and over again, from Rodney King to George Floyd,” said Hageman, Garcia’s attorney. “Before we had body camera footage, we always needed to have some independent witness because we can almost never win a case where it’s our client’s word against the police’s word, because the police are always going to back each other up.” But body cameras are far from a cure-all for police accountability. After they were introduced in Minneapolis in 2016, officers rarely turned them on, making them little better than a $400 brooch. An internal audit found that in the first year of use, police officers were turning their body cameras on when they were required to just 65% of the time. The department’s SWAT team officers were not using body cameras at all. The reason for the infrequent use, according to the audit, was that officers had broad discretion in deciding when to use them. There was also a glaring management problem detailed in the audit: Supervisors were supposed to review video recordings to ensure officers were using body cameras, but failed to do so. What forced a change to the department’s body camera policy was the 2017 killing of Justine Damond, who called 911 to report a possible assault and then was shot by former Officer Mohamed Noor. Neither Noor nor his partner had their dash camera or body cameras turned on at the time of the shooting. After that, Arradondo changed the policy to require officers to turn on their cameras for any police-related activity, in line with what the city’s civilian oversight commission had recommended two years before Damond’s killing, before the city adopted the cameras department-wide. Police use of body cameras has steadily risen since, with compliance today estimated to be around 95%. Despite early troubles with compliance, just one officer has ever been disciplined for not turning on her body camera, according to city data. Heather Sterzinger, the same officer accused of roughing up a drunk woman, received a letter of reprimand 20 months after not turning on her body camera in a different incident. Research suggests body cameras make police officers more honest. A recent study of officers in New York found those with body cameras reported 40% more stops, likely because officers are more inclined to document their work if they know they’re being recorded. And yet, body camera footage is often only reviewed if a complaint triggers an investigation. As in the case with Chauvin and the 14-year-old boy he knelt on 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 14/24 for 17 minutes, officers’ reports may not trigger review of bodycam video or further investigation. As part of Minneapolis’s legal agreement with the state’s Department of Human Rights, police officers are required to report unauthorized use of force they see, and body camera footage may be audited by the city’s Office of Police Conduct Review, an agency within the city’s Department of Civil Rights that investigates some allegations of police misconduct. Although body cameras should make disciplinary investigations easier and more accurate, they haven’t shortened the length of investigations in Minneapolis. Fewer than a dozen cases from 2017 had been resolved by the end of 2019, according to city data. The use of “coaching” provides another crypt into which citizen complaints against the Police Department can be disposed of. The city has said the practice of diverting complaints into retraining opportunities — which keeps the matter off the discipline books – is only used for minor policy violations, like speeding and inappropriate language, allowing the city to prioritize more severe incidents for investigation. But city records reveal that coaching has been used in allegations involving excessive force, failure to provide protection, discrimination, and police retaliation and harassment. The specifics of the allegations — and the names of the officers involved — aren’t revealed to the public, however, because the city considers coaching a “non-disciplinary” outcome. “I don’t think anyone is going to have a problem with low-level problems being sent to coaching, particularly because it is likely very effective,” said Andrew Gordon, deputy director for community legal services at The Legal Rights Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit. “But some of the things that we’re seeing getting referred [to coaching] are not low-level offenses.” Abigail Cerra, a lawyer who joined the city’s Police Conduct Oversight Commission, earlier this year, said it’s unclear what coaching involves. “It was a really difficult process to find out what coaching is,” Cerra said. “I couldn’t get staff to answer my questions, people started shutting me down, and no one wanted to talk to me.” After Cerra drafted a report making the case that complaints which result in coaching are discipline and thus public information, the city attorney issued a memorandum stating that the department can withhold coaching data because it’s merely a spontaneous informal conversation with a supervisor. But Cerra said there’s nothing spontaneous about a formal complaint being lodged against a police officer. Cerra said many complainants receive a letter stating their complaint has been closed with no discipline. “If I were a complainant, I would think nothing happened,” Cerra said. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 15/24 Some attorneys have also expressed concern that since discipline files of an officer involved in a case must be disclosed to the defense, the use of coaching conceals from them an unknowable amount of misconduct. “When the city aids in that failure to disclose by  hiding these disciplinary decisions it undeniably contributes to the perversion of our criminal legal system,” said Gordon in a September letter to the city, which was co-signed by several civil rights and racial justice organizations. Imani Jaafar, who heads the Office of Police Conduct Review, referred an interview request to interim civil rights director Frank Reed, who did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. … Police prepare to open fire with tear gas and non-lethal rounds on a group of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd while he was in police custody on May 29, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images. UNDISCIPLINED BEHAVIOR on the part of some rank-and-file officers and lack of accountability from Minneapolis Police Department management was abundantly clear in George Floyd’s May 25 death and its aftermath. After Chauvin ignored Floyd’s pleas for his life on camera, protests swelled. Arrandondo told the press, “I directed our folks to practice restraint. That meant, quite frankly, that a building was significantly damaged. But I’d rather have that than our officers being involved in an encounter where either they get hurt physically or a person from our community gets hurt.” And yet, scattered instances of a thrown water bottle at police were met with rubber bullets fired indiscriminately into crowds, permanently blinding a journalist in one eye and at least one demonstrator. A group of reporters and another group of protestors have filed class action lawsuits. The police also sprayed chemical irritants without provocation, including a now-infamous incident of an officer spraying peaceful protesters with mace from the driver’s window of a squad car. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 16/24 Unchecked behavior of officers — coupled with a failure to arrest violent agitators — escalated tensions to potentially deadly levels for protesters and police alike. As protests turned to riots, the mayor ordered police to abandon the Third Precinct to avoid loss of life; officers retreated behind the remaining police stations, barricaded as people from across the region set fire to the city. Meanwhile, Kroll flexed the union’s muscle when he sent a letter to the rank- and-file amid the riots blasting Frey and Gov. Tim Walz and hinting he would form an alliance with state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, to take control of the National Guard, a brazen act that illustrated his own perceived influence. On June 10, Arradondo said he was withdrawing from contract negotiations with the police union, which had come to be seen as the biggest institutional barrier to reform, blocking new policies and protecting problem cops under the banner of organized labor. But in fact, just the chief withdrew, since ending negotiations would have exposed the city to potential labor lawsuits. Arradondo also said the Police Department would adopt a system that alerts supervisors to complaints against an officer, as the U.S. Department of Justice recommended in 2015. He argued it would put the department at the vanguard of policing, and give supervisors the tools to intervene before an officer could act as Chauvin did when he kneeled on Floyd’s neck. “For the first time in the history of policing, we here in Minneapolis will have an opportunity to use real-time data and automation to intervene with officers who are engaged in problematic behavior,” he told reporters. The implication was that the department’s leaders didn’t yet have the ability to keep track of patterns that signal trouble: multiple use of force complaints; fights outside the job; even prosaic signals like being late for work could all indicate a troubled officer. “There have been questions raised about when an incident occurs, ‘Well, Chief Rondo, how come you didn’t know about this person and this number of complaints?’ and what have you. We need to reevaluate that. We need to do it with real-time data,” Arradondo said. Early intervention systems aren’t new. They’ve been around for more than three decades, and aren’t new to the Minneapolis Police Department, which started such a system in 2009. But police sergeants and other supervisors didn’t use it, so there was little data to analyze, according to the 2015 Department of Justice report. Arrandondo knows this history well because he’s seen the department’s flawed disciplinary system up close for more than two decades. Even as the Minneapolis Police Department rewarded problem white officers with promotions and awards, Black officers accused the department of unfairly 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 17/24 meting out discipline. Arradondo was one of five Black officers to sue the department in 2007 for discrimination. The lawsuit details how a Black precinct inspector was demoted for allegedly driving a squad car under the influence, and he was replaced by Sauro, the white cop who had been disciplined and sued multiple times for brutality. The city settled the suit in 2009 for $740,000, and then, in 2013, then-Chief Janeé Harteau tapped Arradondo to lead the Internal Affairs Unit, overseeing the department’s investigations into officer misconduct. In 2014, the Department of Justice under President Barack Obama reviewed Minneapolis Police Department’s early intervention system and its other oversight processes and found them failing. The DOJ also reported the department’s primary intervention was to refer officers to “coaching.” Even though Arradondo claimed in 2020 that the new early warning system would be a critical management tool, he sought funding through a philanthropic foundation, not the police budget. The philanthropy pulled out and again the program stalled. It resurfaced this month during budget negotiations. The chief insisted the program had to be separated from discipline in order to be effective. Setting aside the lack of a real-time data system, supervisors often don’t know their subordinates have any complaints against them. One Minneapolis supervisor said they aren’t told about one of their officers being disciplined until after it happens — sometimes years after the event. “Every cop could have two or three complaints ongoing against them. And I’d know nothing about it. No one tells us,” said a current Minneapolis Police Department supervisor, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Picture a school district in which a principal doesn’t know a teacher is under investigation for poor performance, racial bias against a student, or sexual harassment. The same police source says the department also fails to adequately train new sergeants and lieutenants in holding their officers accountable. “Our department does a terrible job of training supervisors how to be supervisors,” the source said. Sergeants and lieutenants also don’t have much authority to hold their officers accountable. They can’t issue a suspension or letter of reprimand, for instance, a fact that’s used to keep them in the same bargaining unit as patrol officers. What they can do is write reports, and wait for the chief to make a decision. … 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 18/24 Security video show Minneapolis Police Officer Blayne Lehner pushing a woman down in her apartment building in August 2014. His termination for the use of force would be overturned by an arbitrator. THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT didn’t begin investigating Blayne Lehner for breaking Luis Garcia’s face until nearly two years after it happened, and not until Garcia filed a lawsuit against the city. Garcia first had to clear up the charge against him for underage drinking — the only criminal conviction to come out of that traffic stop. “Someone who is the victim of police excessive force often has to play defense before they can go on offense,” Hageman, Garcia’s lawyer, said, “And that was the case here.” For weeks after his arrest, Garcia’s jaw was wired shut and he could only eat food his mom liquefied in the blender. He lost his job as a forklift driver because he couldn’t leave the house. Doctors also performed multiple root canals because the kick or kicks to Garcia’s face not only knocked out his top two teeth but killed his bottom front teeth as well, he said. Even with multiple pain medications, he could still feel throbbing pain in his face. Sleeping was no less painful. “I had nightmares about getting arrested again and having my teeth ripped out. And then I’d wake up and my teeth were ripped out,” Garcia said. Doctors recommended dental implants for his two front teeth, which he couldn’t afford because he was uninsured. “My sister was working two jobs at the time, and my mom was taking care of me,” Garcia said. In that time, Lehner stayed on the street but soon became the subject of another excessive force allegation. While responding to a call of a domestic dispute between two women in August 2014, Lehner pushed one of the women down twice, slapped her 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 19/24 phone out of her hand while she was talking to 911 dispatch and allegedly called her a “c**t.” Lehner denied to investigators that he ever used that word, according to discipline documents. The woman was drunk and acting aggressive, Lehner would tell investigators, although he said he did not feel personally threatened. He didn’t arrest her. He never filed a use of force report, but an investigation was opened two days later because the property manager saw the footage on the building’s surveillance tape. She demanded a meeting with Lehner’s supervisor, saying it was the second time in the past week a resident had told her an officer called them a “c**t.” “One of my big issues is, these officers … come to my building, are rude to me, rude to my residents and don’t actually take care of the issue they were called for,” Alyssa Kiffmeyer wrote in an email to Minneapolis sergeants at the 5th precinct. The Office of Police Conduct Review finished its 75-page investigation into the incident some 14 months later in October 2015. By then, the city had just started its investigation into Lehner kicking Garcia and had put him on paid administrative leave the month prior. Harteau, who was then the chief, terminated Lehner in January 2016. Lehner appealed his termination for pushing and swearing at the woman, which went to arbitration. The arbitrator, Stephen Befort, overturned the termination and reduced it to a 40-hour suspension, reasoning that Lehner’s behavior wasn’t egregious enough for termination given his relatively clean disciplinary record. The department had paused its investigation into Lehner’s use of force against Garcia, so the arbitrator wasn’t able to consider that event in making his decision. Harteau issued a statement blasting the arbitrator’s decision saying, “These rulings hinder my ability, as a Police Chief, to create an effective culture of accountability within the Department.” Shortly after Floyd’s death, Arradondo echoed his predecessor: “There is nothing more debilitating,” he said, than when an arbitrator “not only allows for that employee to be back on your department but to be patrolling in your communities.” Police officers who are terminated are reinstated a little less than half the time through arbitration — about the same rate for other public employees — but the disciplinary cases that make it to arbitration are rare. Despite their rarity, city and police department leaders blame arbitration for dragging out disciplinary cases and reversing disciplinary decisions. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 20/24 Critics also say arbitrators are prone to a “meet in the middle” resolution, which winds up favoring the police union. But the Minneapolis Police Department often fails to show arbitrators that problem officers have a history of misconduct. In one case, an arbitrator reduced the discipline of a police sergeant for sexually harassing his subordinate because the department couldn’t show he had the pattern of abuse they said he did. A female police officer reported Sgt. Kent Warnberg for allegedly making inappropriate sexual comments to her on two separate occasions in 2013, according to the disciplinary files. Eleven months after the incident was reported, Harteau issued her disciplinary decision, which was later reduced to a 90-day demotion by the arbitrator. In explaining her decision, Harteau wrote, “During my review I learned this complaint was not the first incident of inappropriate conduct.” The arbitrator notes, however, “No evidence of prior disciplinary action or corrective action appears on the grievant’s record.” In fact, this is the only case of discipline against Warnberg in his more than three decades on the Minneapolis police force, although he was convicted in Wisconsin of sexually assaulting a private at a National Guard training in 1992 while he was a captain. He was reinstated to the police force. Warnberg said he couldn’t remember making any such comments but stopped short of denying it, according to disciplinary documents. Of the 10 Minneapolis Police employees who were interviewed, only one said they might have heard anything. Warnberg retired earlier this year. The department also often fails to show that they’re not disciplining an officer more harshly than others. The union frequently argues there’s been “disparate treatment,” pointing to officers who’ve only received a letter of reprimand for kicking suspects, for example. “In my view, it is a problem with inconsistent management,” said labor expert Joe Slater. While disparate treatment arguments are meant to ensure police officers are treated fairly, they can also cement a bad precedent. If the department hasn’t consistently fired officers for kicking handcuffed suspects in the face or sexually harassing a subordinate, the union may successfully argue that the officer must be treated like others. And then that officer receives a lesser punishment, which is used as a precedent the next time an officer comes before an arbitrator for a similar offense. And so the snake goes on eating its own tail. Department leaders blame the union and arbitration for being time consuming, even though litigating employment disputes before a judge and'"

Copies of these documents were  obtained and Body Worn Camera (BWC) videos from the officers involved were reviewed. The complaint  was assigned for investigation on July 10, 2017. The Complainant was interviewed and her statement  recorded on August 15, 2017.  On March 19, 2018, this office received from Edina Police Department a CD disc containing several files:  audio of (2) phone calls between Minneapolis dispatch and Edina Dispatch, redacted transcription of (2)  9-1-1 calls, and a redacted Event Report #2017-050454.  13.43 - Personnel Data  On May 4, 2018, emails were sent to Officer 13.43  13.43 and Sgt. Shannon Barnette, informing  them that they had been scheduled to appear at the Office of Police Conduct Review to provide  statements in this matter. On May 8, 2018, the investigator received a voice message from Assistant City  Attorney Brian Carter. He said that he was representing Sgt. Barnette in a lawsuit brought by the  complainant in this matter. The investigator spoke with Mr. Carter on May 8, 2018, and Mr. Carter stated  that both Sgt.

As Officer 13.43 was walking to the  squad, he could be heard saying, \"Oh boy, she\\'s fired up.\" Officer 13.43 appeared to check  something on the squad computer before returning to the front door. When he arrived at the  door, Privacy Policy was talking with Officer 13.43 and was holding a cell phone and appeared  to be recording the contact with the officers. Privacy Policy said she thought that the officers were  present at her home in response to a 9-1-1 call she made at \"9:56 a.m.\" Officer 13.43 told  that they were there because she ( Privacy Policy was harassing or threatening one of her  family members.

Privacy Policy was also upset as she complained that no  officers responded to her earlier 9-1-1 call. The call taker told her that officers were sent on the  first call and Privacy Policy said she was home and she wasn\\'t contacted. She asked that the  Precinct Commander call her right away. The call taker said he didn\\'t have the commander\\'s  direct number but he\\'d have the sergeant call her. The call taker also informed Privacy Policy that  the officers who were just there were sent to contact her based on a call from an anonymous  relative. Privacy Policy was still angry at the end of the call and the call taker said he would have  the Sergeant call her.8 3.

Privacy Policy further alleged, \"...a physician acknowledged that I was being illegally detained and  released me. I was forced to walk home two miles in the middle of the night.\"  Privacy Policy was interviewed regarding her complaint on August 15, 2017. She briefly discussed the first  time Officer 13.43 and Officer 13.43 arrived at her home. She said it was about 8:20 p.m. and she asked  them if they were there regarding her call to 9-1-1 earlier in the day14 for a person sitting on the retaining  wall in the alley behind her home and whom she believed was smoking marijuana. They told her they did  not know about that call and they were there about \"a cousin and threats, but they weren\\'t giving me  any details.\"15 She said she asked who called and Officer 13.43 went back to the squad car. When he  returned to the front door, he apologized and they left. Privacy Policy said she called 9-1-1 after the  officers left to complain about being harassed at her home.16 Privacy Policy stated that, at about 9:40 to 9:45 p.m., she \"heard a commotion at my front door...I had the  screen door locked and the front wooden door locked and observed three Minneapolis police officers  breaking down the door of my home.\"1-7 She asked them what they were doing and they continued to  \"break down the door.\" Privacy Policy said she closed the door and called 9-1-1 for help, but the officers  \"pounded on the door\"18. When she opened the door again, the officers \"charged into my home...Two of  them assaulted me.\"1° Privacy Policy further stated, \"They proceeded to make nonsensical statements.  Barnette said I had called 9-1-1 a million times, quote, end quote. Um, and, ah, was, um, telling me that  she had decided I was in a mental health crisis.\"20 Privacy Policy said she was taken to Fairview Southdale Hospital where she was seen by a doctor. He asked  her a few questions before he released her. She left the hospital around midnight and she then had to  walk home.  During her statement, Privacy Policy denied calling anyone and making threats against them. She stated, \"I  didn\\'t threaten anybody at any point in time on May 25th or any other date.

She said this conversation occurred after she  called 9-1-1 following her contact with Officers 13.43 and 13.43 (the 8:21 p.m. call). Regarding this  conversation, Privacy Policy said Sgt. Barnette \"seemed totally uninterested and dismissive of any concerns  that I had. Rude. Unresponsive.\"22 When asked if Sgt. Barnette asked her any questions about her specific  state of mind at that time, Privacy Policy simply said, \"No.\"23 Privacy Policy  Edina PD.  was also asked about the 9-1-1 calls she made during which she asked to be transferred to  Privacy Policy stated:  \"I called.

Specifically, the hospital report states that in relay, in  regard to me, quote: her apartment was a mess and so they were concerned about whether she  could take care of herself.  \"My closest friends tease me mercilessly about the fact that you could eat off the floors at my  house.

Fairview Southdale Hospital denies that, ah, they had any  information to make such a bizarre statement and, ah, speculated that the people who dumped  me there were looking for any reason whatsoever to justify their conduct. That\\'s the kind of  bizarre misstatements that have been made in this case.\" 26 As mentioned above in the discussion of the BWC videos, Officer 13.43  BWC captured some footage  showing the interior of Privac Polic home, including the living room area, the upstairs office, and the  statement above in her depiction of the  kitchen. This video footage appears to corroborate  condition of her home.  Medical Records  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy  was admitted into the hospital at 10:14 P.M. She was evaluated by Doctor Robert James  Anderson in the Emergency Department and discharged to go home at 12:46 A.M. The following  information was included in the medical report under the heading \"Medical Decision Making\":  \"The patient is brought in by police on a hold. She was very angry with the staff. I saw the patient  and she was very angry with me as well. I explained to the patient the process of police officer  holds and the need to undergo medical screening to make sure that there is no significant acute  medical or mental health disorder requiring admission the hospital. Although there may be  underlying mental health disorders in this patient with a history of depression and anxiety, there  may be component of some paranoid behavior, but after spending approximately 20 minutes  with the patient, she was somewhat rational and I do not believe that the patient is hold-able.  The pt admitted to drinking earlier and does have a legal amount of alcohol in her system now  and this may have contributed the the circumstances earlier. The patient elected to go home. She  did not want to be admitted to the hospital. Again, she did not have any medical concerns that  she wanted me to address. No trauma to suggest intracranial bleed; no headache, no focal neuro  deficit etc.\" 27 DISCUSSION  Allegation 1  The Minneapolis Police Department\\'s Policy and Procedure Manual states in part:  5-103 USE OF DISCRETION  The police profession is one that requires officers to use considerable judgment and discretion in  the performance of their daily duties. Officers have a large body of knowledge from Department  25 Patient Medical Report, Privacy Policy dated 05/25/2017, Page 5, \"Medical Decision Making\", Line 3  26 Ibid, Page 10 lines 9-22  27 Ibid., Page 5, \"Medical Decision Making\", paragraph 2  Page 9 of 27  1332759 policies and procedures, training, their own professional police experience and the experiences  of their fellow officers to guide them in exercising proper judgment and discretion in situations  not specifically addressed by Department rules and regulations. In addition, officers must always  adhere to the following principles in the course of their employment with the Minneapolis Police  Department:  •  POLICE ACTION - LEGALLY JUSTIFIED: Officers must act within the limits of their authority as  defined by law and judicial interpretation, thereby ensuring that the constitutional rights of  individuals and the public are protected. All investigative detentions, pedestrian and vehicle  stops, arrests, searches and seizures of property by officers will be based on a standard of  reasonable suspicion or probable cause in accordance with the Fourth Amendment of the  U.S. Constitution and statutory authority. Officers must be able to articulate specific facts,  circumstances and conclusions that support reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  (11/17/15)  •  EQUALITY OF ENFORCEMENT: Officers shall provide fair and impartial law enforcement to all  citizens.  •  LOYALTY: Officers shall be faithful to their oath of office, strive to uphold the principles of  professional police service, and advance the mission of the Department.  5-105  PROFESSIONAL CODE OF CONDUCT (01/05/16)  A. General  4.  Employees shall use reasonable judgment in carrying out their duties and  responsibilities. They need to weigh the consequences of their actions. (04/01/05)  (05/03/05) (01/05/16)  Privacy Policy alleged that the officers in this matter forced entry into her home and had her taken to a  hospital for mental health evaluation without justification. Officer 13.43 and Officer  13.43  both  indicate in their reports that the decision to place a mental health hold on Privacy Policy was made by Sgt.  Barnette, prior to arriving at Privac Polic residence.28 Since Sgt. Barnette did not complete a CAPRS  supplement report (discussed below under Allegation 3), there is no articulation of \"specific facts,  circumstances, and conclusions\" in the CAPRS report to support the actions that Sgt. Barnette directed to  be taken in this matter.  Minnesota Statute 253B.05, Subd. 2. states, \"A peace or health officer may take a person into custody  and transport the person to a licensed physician or treatment facility if the officer has reason to believe,  either through direct observation of the person\\'s behavior, or upon reliable information of the person\\'s  recent behavior and knowledge of the person\\'s past behavior or psychiatric treatment, that the person is  mentally ill or developmentally disabled and in danger of injuring self or others if not immediately  detained.\" The statute also states, \"The peace or health officer shall make written application for  admission of the person to the treatment facility. The application shall contain the peace or health  officer\\'s statement specifying the reasons for and circumstances under which the person was taken into  custody. If danger to specific individuals is a basis for the emergency hold, the statement must include  identifying information on those individuals, to the extent practicable.\"  28 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1, paragraph 4 and Supplement 2, paragraph 3, line 6, [3]  Page 10 of 27  1332760 The Minneapolis Police Department\\'s Policy and Procedure Manual states in part:  7-1003  MENTALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS (05/06/15)  Felony suspects who are mentally impaired shall be booked in the jail unless otherwise ordered  by a superior officer. Officers booking a mentally impaired person shall advise the jail and the  applicable investigating unit.  Officers dealing with disturbed mentally impaired persons have the authority to transport and  hold them pending a medical/ psychological review by a physician as mandated by the  Hospitalization and Commitment Act of the Minnesota Statutes (Minn. Stat. 2538.0552&3).  Officers attempting to use the powers granted by this law shall be familiar with its  requirements. (07/28/89)  Officer  13.43  Officer 13 43 :  Officer 13.43 was partnered with Officer 13.43 on 05/25/2017, in Squad 530. He was not deposed in  the civil action filed by Privacy Policy and he was not available for an interview due to his employment  status following this incident. He completed a supplement report to the CAPRS report which was filed in  this matter.29 In his report, Officer 13.43 wrote that Officer 13.43 and he were dispatched to  after an anonymous male caller requested officers to check on Privacy Policy welfare. Officer  that the male caller alleged that Privacy Policy had placed a threatening phone call to him. Officer  report does not contain any facts or details relevant to the alleged threats, nor does the report list the  identity of the male caller. Officer 13.43 stated in his report that they arrived at Privac Polic residence  at 19:38 hours. This appears to be incorrect as VisiNet lists the time they were assigned to the call at  20:05 hours, arriving on scene at 20:14.  Privac Polic  13.43  home  wrote  13.43  Officer 13.43 wrote that Privacy Policy was \"agitated and uncooperative,\" asking the officers why they  were at her property. Officer 13.43 said he attempted to calm  Privacy Policy down; however, she  continued to shout at them. He wrote that the remarks in the call were related to a male, so they  apologized and cleared the call. The VisiNet report shows 20:26 hours as the time that the call was  completed.3°  Officer  to  13.43 Supplement report lists two different times that Officer 13.43 and he were dispatched  Privacy Policy home for the second time. In his second paragraph, he wrote:  Privacy Policy  \"At approx. 21:23 hours, we were dispatched to Check Welfare at  In paragraph seven, he wrote:  \"5/25/201721:34 hours, we were dispatched for the second time (17-191393).\"  The information given in paragraph seven appears to list the time incorrectly. The VisiNet Incident Detail  Report for this call states that officers were assigned to the call at 21:23 hours.31 Officer 13.43 wrote, \"Prior to arriving, Sgt. Barnette had advised my partner and Ito place a Health and  Welfare hold on OT ppi \" 32 He also wrote, \"Prior to our arrival we requested EMS and they staged  a block away.\" 33 This information is corroborated by the comments entered into the VisiNet Incident  Detail Report, which state:  29 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1  3° VisiNet Incident Detail Report #17-191155  31 VisiNet Incident Detail Report #17-191393  32 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1, paragraph 3  33 Ibid, paragraph 7  Page 11 of 27  1332761 5/25/2017  21:05:53  CT031779  Response  [3] PER SGT BARNETTE SQD 502 - OFCRS TO SIGN A  HEALTH AND WELFARE HOLD ON THIS SUBJECT - SGT  BARNETTE HAS ALSO  SPOKEN W/THERESA AND ATTEMPTED TO ADVISE HER  5/25/2017  21:06:11  CT031779  Response  [4] **OFCRS TO SIGN HEALTH/WELFARE HOLD PER  502\"\"  5/25/2017  21:26:26  530  Response  [7] START EMS CODE 2 PLZ...

Barnette  Following his statement that they were dispatched for the second time, Officer 13.43 paraphrased  comments from the VisiNet report into his supplement. He wrote that, since the first incident,  appeared to be getting more and more agitated making numerous calls to dispatch and not  making sense. He added that she appeared to be in a \"mild manic state\", information which is not stated  in VisiNet and which he had not yet had the opportunity to observe for himself.35 After knocking on the  door, Privacy Policy opened the door and appeared \"angry and agitated.\" She then slammed the door and  asked them to leave. At that point Sgt. Barnette removed the screen from the screen door and knocked  until Privacy Policy opened the door. Officer 13.43 report does not contain any information about the  officers entering Privacy Policy home and physically restraining her.  PPI  PPI  Paragraph 8 appears to contain Officer 13.43 reasoning for placing Privacy Policy on a mental health hold.  He referred to Privacy Policy \"thought pattern\" as being \"scattered\". He wrote that she \"kept referring to  her cousin in Edina who was being \\'financially exploited—. She \"uttered\" that she sent an email to  Inspector Waite and Mayor Hodges. She lived alone. He summed it up, writing, \"Upon assessing the  situation, we determine to place OT  PPI  on a health and wellness hold. Primary due to OT/  mild manic and agitated state at the moment she was unable to care for herself.\"36 PPI  This supplement report does not address the statutory requirement that an officer must have a reason to  believe \"that the person is mentally ill or developmentally disabled and in danger of injuring self or others  if not immediately detained.\" 37 Officer 13.43  13.43  Officer 13.43 is listed in the CAPRS report as the reporting officer. The report is coded for a Forced  Entry Report as well as Crisis Intervention. The Public Data statement on page one states:  \"Officers responded to the above location for a check the welfare. Per shift Sgt, squad 502, OT1  was placed on a hold. She was transported to the Hospital by the Ambulance (Run # 17037649).\"  38  Officer 13.43 also completed a supplement report for this incident. In this supplement report, she  included some of the text of the VisiNet Incident Detail Report, which discussed prior responses to her  home on that date. This data states that the officers responding to Privacy Policy home were directed by  Sgt. Barnette to sign a health and welfare hold on Privacy Policy . This data also states that some member  of Privac Polic family called Edina PD, who in turn called Minneapolis Police Department, to say that  she may fight with police.39 34 VisiNet Incident Detail Report #17-191393  35 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1, paragraph 7  36 Ibid, paragraph 8  37 Minnesota Statute 253B.05, Subd. 2.  38 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Page 1, Public Data  39 Ibid, Supplement 2, paragraph 3  Page 12 of 27  1332762 Officer 13.43 wrote that she rang the front door bell and Privacy Policy answered, telling them she did  not call the police.

She was taken into custody until the Ambulance arrived. OT1 was advised she  needed help (Crisis). She continued to tell Officers that we are harassing her.\" 41 Officer 13.43 reported that Privacy Policy appeared to very agitated and upset and she stated that  officers were \"kidnaping\" her from her home. She also complained that officers were holding her arms  too tightly, so they allowed her to sit while awaiting an ambulance. Officer 13.43 reported that  was placed on a hold at the direction of \"Squad 502\", which was Sgt. Barnette\\'s call sign on that  PPI  date.  PPI  There is no discussion in Officer 13.43  report of Privacy Policy possibly being mentally ill. In the only  discussion of Privacy Policy state of mind, Officer 13.43 wrote, \"OT1 appeared to be very agitated and  upset...Throughout the whole time, OT1 was very argumentative, agitated, and uncooperative.\" 42 There  is no information in this report stating that Privacy Policy was a danger to herself or any other person. The  comment placed in VisiNet by Emergency Communication Center personnel warns officers that  may fight with them; however, there is no statement in this report or any other reports that  offered any resistance to them or verbalized any threat.  PPI  PPI  Application By Peace or Health Officer For Emergency Admission:  PPI  PPI  Prior to Privac Polic transport to Fairview Southdale Hospital, Officer 13.43 filled out and signed the  Application By Peace or Health Officer For Emergency Admission form. The form requires the officer  completing the form to state under what circumstances and for what reasons the person on whom they  placed the hold was taken into custody. The following information was submitted by Officer 13.43  \"Female continuously called 911 and per dispatcher female was verbally agitated and not making  sense. Per Shift Sgt, Squad 502, a hold was place [sic] on the female.\" 43 There is no information in this statement to explain why the officers believed Privacy Policy was \"mentally  ill, mentally retarded or chemically dependent and in imminent danger of injuring self or others.\" It  simply states that a dispatcher found Privacy Policy \"verbally agitated\" when she called 9-1-1 so Sgt.  Barnette wanted a mental health hold placed on her.  Deposition of Officer  Officer 13.43  13.43  13.43  was deposed on 01/18/2018.44 In her deposition during direct examination, Officer  said that her partner (Officer 13.43) and she were dispatched to  check on her welfare since. She recalled information in the call that  \"threatening her family.\"45 Officer 13.43 said they contacted  the officers were there and she didn\\'t understand why.

When Officer 13.43 returned to the front door, he apologized and they left.  Officer 13.43  13.43  was asked if Privacy Policy threatened them or anyone else with violence and Officer  stated, \"Not to my knowledge that she threatened anyone besides what our call remarks said.\" 46 Officer 13.43 was then asked if they followed up any information which was provided in the call and  she replied she did not call anyone. She also testified that she did not observe anything to indicate  was a danger to herself or to others and she had no information that Privacy Policy had any  mental illness.47 PPI  PPI  Officer 13.43 then was asked about the second call to Privac Polic residence. She said a second call  came to them on their squad computer screen to return to Privac Polic home. When asked what  information was provided to them regarding the call, she replied that all she could recall were \"pieces of  the remarks that she was calling 9-1-1 very agitated, several times.\" 48 Officer 13.43 was questioned about the purpose for returning to Privac Polic residence. She said  that, according to the remarks in the call, Sgt. Barnette had ordered that Privacy Policy was to be placed  on a \"hold\" and that she would be taken to the hospital regardless of whether she was willing to go.49 Officer 13.43 also testified that she had no knowledge about why she would be taken to the hospital  outside of the call remarks.5°  Officer 13.43 was questioned about her understanding of the reasons someone would be placed on a  hold. She replied:  \"A. Some of the reasons may be if they\\'re -- they want to harm themselves, they want to harm  others. They can\\'t take care of themselves or others. These are just some of the things.  \"Q. Any other reasons that you can recall?  \"A. I\\'m pretty sure there is. I just can\\'t think of all of it right at this second.\" 51 Then she was asked specifically about Privacy Policy  \"Q. What is your understanding of the reason that Privacy Policy was going to be taken to the  hospital?  \"A. Her call remarks, sir.  \"Q. Okay. In terms of the criteria for putting a hold on someone, do you know if any of these  criteria that you mentioned apply?  \"A. Well, per call remarks, whatever my sergeant said that\\'s what goes.  \"Q. You weren\\'t trying to determine for yourself what the reason was for holding  \"A. At that point, no.\" 52 Privacy Policy 7  Officer  13.43  was asked several questions regarding Minneapolis Police Department policy and  Minnesota statutes that give officers authority to place an individual on a mental health hold.  \"Q. So as you sit here, you are not able to describe what the statute says?  46 Ibid., Page 22, line 7-8  47 Ibid., Page 21, line 21 through Page 22, line 25  48 Ibid., Page 24, line 21  49 Ibid., Page 25, Line 23 and Page 26, line 15  5° Ibid., Page 26, Line 18  5\\' Ibid., Page 27, lines 5-8  52 Ibid., Page 28, line 18 to Page 29, line 6  Page 14 of 27  1332764 \"A.

Officer 13.43 stated that all three officers entered the residence. She testified that  had not given them permission to enter:  \"Q. So why did you enter the house without permission?  \"A. Well, per call remarks, we were to take her and put a hold on her.  \"Q. Okay. So, the purpose was to come into the house and then take her out to the hospital?  \"A. Yes.\" 54 PPI  Officer 13.43 was asked if she determined, after entering the home, if Privacy Policy needed help. She  said, no and it wasn\\'t her call. When asked who\\'s call it was, she said, \"My Sergeant.\"55 Officer  said she didn\\'t have or form an opinion about whether or not Privacy Policy needed help. When asked  13.43  about her observations of Privacy Policy  explain what she meant, Officer 13.43  Officer  stated:  13.43 stated she observed aggression. When asked to  \"Q. When you say \"aggression\" what do you mean by aggression?  \"A. She was yelling. Her hands were on her waist.  \"Q. She was angry, right?  \"A. Yes.  \"Q.

She identified the officers who grabbed Privacy Policy as Officer  and Sgt. Barnette. When asked if she knew why they grabbed her, Officer 13.43 replied, \"No.\"58 Officer 13.43 was asked if she observed anything about  hold to be placed on  knowledge if  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy that she thought would justify a  Officer 13.43 replied, \"No.\"59 Officer  had any diagnosis of mental illness. 60  13.43 also said she had no  Officer 13.43 stated in her deposition that she never got any information about the caller to 9-1-1 who  claimed to be a cousin to Privacy Policy . He was never identified and the officers did not get any  clarification about what this person meant about Privacy Policy threatening him and his family beyond  what\\'s in the remarks. She also stated that the comment \"Unknown mental health Diagnosis\" indicates  that the caller doesn\\'t know if she is diagnosed with any mental illness.61 The Assistant City Attorney began his examination of Officer 13.43 following a thirteen (13) minute  break. He prefaced the questioning by saying that he wanted to \"broaden the questions a little bit beyond  just your direct observations, and ask some questions about reasonable beliefs based not just on those  observations.\" 62 He asked her to read the comments in the VisiNet reports for the two calls Officer  and Officer 13.43 were involved with. The first one was regarding the original 9-1-1 call from the  in which he alleged that Privacy Policy called him and  13.43  person claiming to be a cousin of  threatened him and his family.  The Assistant City Attorney asked her to read the comment that was entered by one of the officers at the  end of the call [Officer 13.43 could not recall who entered the comment] where Privacy Policy was  characterized as \"very aggressive and agitated and uncooperative.\" He did not, however, ask her to read  the comment that follows in which the officer who entered the information writes, \"she appeared to be  A-okay.\"  Privacy Policy  The Assistant City Attorney asked Officer 13.43 about the information related to the 9-1-1 calls made  by Privacy Policy between the first and second call Officer 13.43 responded to. He then asked about the  56 Ibid., Page 37 line 2 throuth Page 38, line 13  57 Transcript of Privac Polic Page 2, lines 40-47  58 United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Civil Case 17-2920, Deposition of Officer  dated 01/18/2018, Page 39, lines 16-21  59 Ibid., Page 45 lines 1-3  60 Ibid., Page 45, line 15-17  61 Ibid., Page 47, line 25 to Page 48, line 20  62 Ibid., Page 69, lines 12-15  Page 16 of 27  13.43  13.43  1332766 comment pertaining to the caller to Edina PD in which the caller warned that  with the police.

He then asked, based on this  information and her experience as a police officer if it was reasonable to believe that Privacy Policy was  mentally ill and a threat to others. Officer 13.43 answered, \"Yes.\"63 Officer 13.43 was questioned again by Privac Polic attorney. The examination began with an inquiry  and subsequent argument between attorneys regarding a meeting that occurred between the Assistant  City Attorney and Officer 13.43 during the break which preceded the examination of Officer  by the Assistant City Attorney.64 Officer 13.43 was the asked if she had any prior knowledge of a mental illness diagnosis of  and she said, \"No.\" She was asked if she spoke to the person who alleged the threats and she said, \"No.\"  She was asked if she knows who that caller is and she said, \"No.\" She was also asked if she knows if that  person was, in fact, a cousin and she, again, said, \"No.\" Officer 13.43 was also asked if she or if anyone  in the Minneapolis Police Department knew the identity of the caller or of the nature of the alleged  threat and she said, \"No, I don\\'t.\"65 \"Q. Do you agree that you don\\'t know if they -- if the threats did occur, you don\\'t know if they  were threats of violence?  13.43  Privacy Policy  \"A. I do not know.  \"Q. Okay.

No, sir.\" 66 Sergeant Shannon Barnette:  Training  During her deposition, Sgt. Barnette was asked if she had any specific training on dealing with people  with mental illness during her career with the Minneapolis Police Department.67 She stated that the  \"majority of the department\" went through a 1-week crisis intervention training program \"approximately  a year ago.\"  Sgt. Barnette was then questioned about other specific training she attended during her career dealing  with people with mental illness. These classes were documented in her training records. One class was  63 Ibid., Page 69, line 11 to Page 75, line 24  64 Ibid., Page 76, line 2 through Page 78, line 7  65 Ibid., Page 78 line 9 through Page 82, line 18  66 Ibid., Page 87, line 21 through Page 88, line 17  67 United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Civil Case 17-2920, Deposition of Sergeant Shannon L.  Barnette dated 01/16/2018, beginning Page 19, line 19  Page 17 of 27  1332767 Trauma Training dated 07/10/2017. When asked if she could remember anything about that training, she  replied, \"No. Not specific.\"68 The next course was Taser training, CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) coach certification, on 12/5/2016. She  stated that, upon completion of the course, she was asked to coach Crisis Intervention; however, when  asked about the course, she stated, \"I don\\'t remember specifics.\"69 Sgt. Barnette discussed Crisis Intervention Team training, 05/09/2016 through 05/13/2016. When asked  if she recalled any specific details about the course dealing with people with mental illness, she, again,  could not recall specific details.7°  One last class mentioned by Sgt. Barnette from her training records was Early Intervention Training from  2010 and 2009. About this course, Sgt. Barnette stated, \"I specifically -- I don\\'t have specifics for you, but  part of it is recognizing people that are struggling mentally, either in crisis or that kind of stuff\" 71 Sgt. Barnette was asked how she can identify if someone has mental illness. She responded, \"I think there  is — I don\\'t know if you can specifically. I think it has to be on a case-by-case basis.\" She was next asked  what\\'s her definition of mental illness. Sgt. Barnette responded, \"Oh. I don\\'t have a specific -- I don\\'t  know if there is one specifically to give.\" 72 Sgt. Barnette was then asked, \"So is that something you do try to identify in your work as a police officer  if someone has a mental illness?\" Sgt. Barnette replied that she would try to identify if she thought  someone was in crisis. She was then asked for her definition of \"in crisis.\" Sgt. Barnette replied that it  could be varying from case to case. When asked for some examples, Sgt. Barnette replied\"  \"Well, there is the example of people that specifically call and say that they are in one. Like I said,  it would be -- it would have to be a specific event that I could give specifics on why I thought that  person was in a crisis.\" 73 Sgt. Barnette was then asked several questions about what she has been taught about responding to  people who are in crisis. Again, she replied that it was a \"case-by-base situation.\" She was next asked if  she had been given any definitions for what it means to be in a crisis. Sgt. Barnette replied, \"Well, I think  that there\\'s many definitions of that. I don\\'t think there is any specific.\"74 \"Q. What are the -- what are the definitions that you\\'re aware of?  \"A. Again, it would have to be something, a specific case.  \"Q. You don\\'t have any specific definitions?  \"A. No.\" 75 Sgt. Barnette was questioned about her knowledge of an officer\\'s authority to place someone on a  mental health hold. 76 She was asked if she had any specific training on placing someone on a mental  health hold. She replied that would have been part of the training on \"dealing with the mentally ill.\"77 When asked which of the training courses discussed previously during her deposition contained that  68 Ibid, Page 23, line 23  69 Ibid, Page 23, line 23 to Page 24, line 13  70 Ibid, Page 24, Line 20 through Page 25, line 4  71 Ibid, Page 25, line 7-9  72 Ibid, Page 25, Line 25 through Page 26, line 12  73 Ibid, Page 26, line 13 to 25  74 Ibid, Page 27, line 16-17  75 Ibid, Page 27, lines 18 through 23  76 Ibid, beginning Page 28, line 2  77 Ibid, Page 28, line 18  Page 18 of 27  1332768 information, she had no recollection.78 When Sgt. Barnette was asked to explain from where her  knowledge of her authority to place someone on a mental health hold came, she replied, \"I  / can\\'t  specifically answer that.\" 79 Sgt. Barnette was questioned about her knowledge of the Minnesota Statute that defines under what  circumstances a person can be placed on a mental health hold. When asked if she was aware of any  criteria given in the statute for when she could place someone on a mental health hold, she replied that  she would have to review the statute to answer the question.8° Sgt. Barnette was asked several questions  regarding the number of persons she placed or caused to be placed on mental health holds. She could  not recall the exact number, however, she recalled having Privacy Policy placed on a hold in this matter.  She was again asked if she recalled the specific statutory criteria for placing someone on a mental health  hold and she replied, \"1 would have to review it.\" 81 Mental Health Hold placed on Privacy Policy :  During her deposition, Sgt. Barnette stated that it was her decision to place Privacy Policy on a mental  health hold. When asked what were her reasons for this decision, Sgt. Barnette replied, \"Oh, there was  several reasons...I felt that she was in a mental health crisis because of her behavior.\"82 Sgt. Barnette was asked to explain all the reasons why Privacy Policy was placed on a hold. Sgt. Barnette  replied, \"Specifically, the information that she was repeatedly calling 911 about an officer not coming to  her home after calling 911 earlier in the day... And when I spoke to her on the phone she seemed quite  upset... She was very agitated. If I remember correctly, she wasn\\'t listening that I -- that an officer had  come out. Very upset.\" 83 Sgt. Barnette was asked if Privacy Policy made any threats of harm or violence  toward her (Sgt. Barnette), herself, or others during this phone call. Sgt. Barnette said she either didn\\'t  believe so or couldn\\'t recall.84 Sgt. Barnette was asked about the 9-1-1 calls placed by Privacy Policy that day. Sgt. Barnette could not say  how many calls were placed nor could she say what the calls were about or the tone of her voice. Sgt.  Barnette also said she did not listen to any of the recordings and did not speak with any of the call  takers.85 Sgt. Barnette discussed the first welfare check call to Privac Polic home by Officer 13.43 and Officer  ; however, Sgt. Barnette did not know many details of that call as she was not there. After  on the phone, she accompanied Officer 13.43 and Officer 13.43 back to  13.43  speaking with  home.  PPI  Privacy Policy  PPI  Sgt. Barnette was asked if there was any other factor(s) upon which she based her decision. Sgt. Barnette  discussed a phone call she had with Privacy Policy a year or more before in which Privacy Policy complained  about circumstances involving the death of her sister. Sgt. Barnette was asked what about that incident  was relevant to her decision to place her on a hold. Sgt. Barnette replied, \"1 just remember that I had  dealt with her on the phone a year or two prior and felt at that point that maybe there was some mental  issues with thinking that her sister was still alive when medical personnel were telling her that she had  passed.\" 86 She was asked if everyone that has mental health issues should be involuntarily hospitalized  and she said, \"No.\"  78 Ibid, Page 28, lines 22 through Page 29, line 1  79 Ibid, Page 29, line 15  80 Ibid, Page 31, linel8 to Page 32, line 18  81 Ibid, Page 34, line 12-15  82 Ibid, Page 35, line 24 to Page 36, line 6  83 Ibid, Page 38, line 6-18  84 Ibid, Page 47, line 14-24  85 Ibid, Page 44, line 4 to Page 45, line 3  86 Ibid, Page 50, line 23 to Page 51, line 5  Page 19 of 27  1332769 Sgt. Barnette was asked if she decided before going to Privacy Policy residence to place her on a hold and  she said, \"No.\" She was asked what was her plan and she said she wanted to talk to her to make sure she  wasn\\'t just angry. She was also asked if she instructed Officer 13.43 and Officer 13.43 to place  on a mental health hold prior to going to the residence. She replied she had not. When  reminded that she was under oath and asked if that was her testimony, she replied, \"Yes.\"87 PPI  PPI  The above testimony from Sgt. Barnette is contradicted by Officer 13.43 supplement report, Officer  13.43 \\' supplement report, and the timeline in the VisiNet Incident Detail Report (CCN #17-191393).  Sgt. Barnette was asked to explain what it was about  PPI  Privacy Policy behavior that caused her to place PPI  on a mental health hold. Sgt. Barnette stated:  \"A. When we got -- she was -- when we got out there she was extremely agitated. Like I said, her  -- she seemed very frazzled, was yelling at us. I had told her, you know, that -- she had made  some comment about someone being in her house. And I said, well, you know, we had just talked  on the phone and she had never said someone was in her house. I believe I said that they were on  a retaining wall. It was just -- she just seemed very upset and just seemed to be in a crisis to me.  I was worried for her.  \"Q. What do you mean by \"a crisis\"?  \"A. That she just -- she wasn\\'t listening to what we were saying. She wasn\\'t being reasonable. I  don\\'t think that when I -- we tried to talk to her about a cousin who had called to check the  welfare, she didn\\'t believe that that had happened. She was talking about Privacy Policy who was  a vulnerable adult. It was very all over the place.\" 88 Sgt. Barnette was asked if that conversation was before or after she decided to place Privacy Policy on a  hold. Sgt. Barnette replied, \"At the point that I decided to place her on a hold is when I removed the  screen door.\"89 There was additional inquiry on this topic:  \"Q. So your testimony was that at the time that you removed the screen door was when you  decided -- you made a final decision you were going to be placing Privacy Policy on a mental health  hold?  \"A. I made the decision to place her on a mental health hold and then removed the screen.  \"Q. Okay. All right. So, that was, obviously, before you entered her house?  \"A. Correct.  \"Q. And up until that time had you had any conversation with her about Privacy Policy  You know,  up until that -- during your visit with her at the house had you had any -- what did you talk -- let  me do it this way.  \"What had you spoken to her about while you were at the house before you removed the screen?  \"A. I just -- I told you what we talked about.  \"Q. Okay. So, your testimony was that you had that conversation before you removed the  screen?  87 Ibid, Page 51, line 25 to Page 52, line 16  88 United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Civil Case 17-2920, Deposition of Sergeant Shannon L.

Dozens of other lawsuits have made similar claims. IN 2013, AMY Krekelberg received an unsettling notice from Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources: An employee had abused his access to a government driver’s license database and snooped on thousands of people in the state, mostly women. Krekelberg learned that she was one of them. MARLIN LEVISON/STAR TRIBUNE/GETTY IMAGES 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 2/5 When Krekelberg asked for an audit of accesses to her DMV records, as allowed by Minnesota state law, she learned that her information—which would include things like her address, weight, height, and driver’s license pictures—had been viewed nearly 1,000 times since 2003, even though she was never under investigation by law enforcement. In fact, Krekelberg was law enforcement: She joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2012, after spending eight years working elsewhere for the city, mostly as an officer for the Park & Recreation Board. She later learned that over 500 of those lookups were conducted by dozens of other cops. Even more eerie, many officers had searched for her in the middle of the night. Krekelberg eventually sued the city of Minneapolis, as well as two individual officers, for violating the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, which governs the disclosure of personal information collected by state motor-vehicle departments. Earlier this week, her case prevailed. On Wednesday, a jury awarded Krekelberg $585,000, including $300,000 in punitive damages from the two defendants, who looked up Krekelberg’s information after she allegedly rejected their romantic advances, according to court documents. “I think that the jury’s verdict shows that people do take privacy quite seriously and that they take women’s privacy seriously,” says Sarah St. Vincent, a surveillance and national security researcher at Human Rights Watch who attended the trial. She is studying similar cases across the country. Louise Matsakis covers Amazon, internet law, and online culture for WIRED. There have been dozens of lawsuits against Minneapolis and other Minnesota cities in recent years over alleged abuses of license databases. Most of the cases were settled out of court or dismissed; Krekelberg’s is the only one to have gone to trial. Two of Krekelberg’s lawyers, Sonia Miller-Van Oort and Jonathan Strauss, say that their client suffered harassment from her colleagues for years as the case proceeded, and that in at least one instance, other cops refused to provide Krekelberg with backup support. She now works a desk job. “We are disappointed in this verdict, but the city takes very seriously the importance of data privacy,” says Susan L. Segal, the Minneapolis city attorney. She stressed that the police department’s policies have changed in recent years. Minneapolis employees are now required 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 3/5 to enter a reason when they search DMV records. Previously, to learn to use the database, officers were encouraged to “go back to work and look up some of [their] friends and family members,” says Segal. “There was not this awareness.” Minnesota did have at least one rare accountability measure in place: It kept a log of when the DMV database was searched, and citizens have the right to request their file. Without that digital trail, Krekelberg likely wouldn’t have had the evidence to bring a case. In many other states, similar protections don’t exist, even for more advanced technologies, like facial recognition software. Policies can differ greatly between police departments, says Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “There’s virtually no uniformity,” she says. That makes it difficult for citizens to know when their information has been improperly accessed by the government, which happens not infrequently. A 2016 investigation by the Associated Press found hundreds of instances where law enforcement officials misused confidential databases for personal purposes, like to dig up dirt on romantic partners, neighbors, and journalists. One Ohio officer ran checks on his ex-girlfriend, and pleaded guilty to stalking her. Two Miami-Dade officers looked up a reporter who published negative stories about their department. “I was a trooper for a long time and it was a common practice for troopers to run someone’s name through the [Massachusetts criminal record] system for reasons besides law enforcement,” Michael Szymanski, a former state trooper who was disciplined for abusing a police database, told CommonWealth Magazine in May. “I can’t tell you how many times I saw troopers run their next-door neighbor through [the system], run their old girlfriends’ names, or run someone who they’re having a dispute with.” The problem goes beyond DMV and criminal records databases. Law enforcement officials have also been caught abusing technology that allows them to monitor the location of people’s cell phones. In April, a former Missouri sheriff was sentenced to six months in prison for tracking a judge and members of the State Highway Patrol. Employees at private tech companies have also abused their access to databases of sensitive user information.

Employees at Snapchat also may have misused an internal tool to spy on users, according to a recent Motherboard investigation. More lawmakers have started advocating for data privacy regulations at the state and federal level, but those conversations have mostly focused on reining in big tech companies, rather than information that public employees can access. “It’s very hard for people to get any kind of redress for privacy violations,” St. Vincent says.

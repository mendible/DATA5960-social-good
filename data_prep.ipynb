He ripped Luis Garcia’s 5-foot-5, 125-pound body from the car and dropped him face down on the concrete. Garcia remembers feeling blows to his face before he lost consciousness. Three years later, when the Minneapolis Police Department was investigating the events of that night in December 2013, his sister Miriam Garcia said she heard loud noises like “someone hitting something metal.” She got out of the car she was waiting in to find her little brother motionless on the pavement, blood pooling beneath his face as five or six cops stood around him. “Luis, just get up!” she screamed. “Stop playing. You’re scaring me.” She tried to get closer, but an officer cut her off, saying “That’s enough. Shut the f**k up. Just get back in the car.” The next thing Luis Garcia remembers is feeling excruciating pain as an unfamiliar voice commanded him to get up. He was placed back in the squad car, dizzy and his mouth so full of blood he couldn’t speak. Garcia’s account can be found in the 26-page investigative report of the incident, one of 195 police disciplinary files obtained by the Reformer through lengthy and ongoing freedom-of-information litigation with the city of Minneapolis. By\\xa0 Max Nesterak | Tony Webster  - December 15, 2020 Illustration by Rob Dobi for Minnesota Reformer. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 2/24 The officer remembers the incident differently. Lehner told investigators Garcia was just “bleeding from his lip a little bit” and “was talking with us just fine” as they drove him in their squad car to the emergency room, according to the disciplinary file. Doctors would find he had a broken jaw, several facial fractures and two missing front teeth. It was a tragic outcome for a traffic stop that turned up no serious crimes. Garcia had been riding home from a house party with his sister and a couple of friends when they were pulled over for appearing to speed up toward a police officer crossing the road. The driver would testify he didn’t know the dark shape in the street was a police officer and revved his engine because his car horn was broken. Police caught up to him six blocks away and arrested him at gunpoint. Lehner and his partner didn’t arrive on the scene until after another officer had radioed in “code four,” meaning everything was under control, and left. Garcia, who was sitting in the back seat, had a few drinks that night and got mouthy with police. “They kept asking me for identification, when I told them I didn’t have one. I told them I can give you my information. So I talked back like, ‘I don’t have an ID, but I’m not a f**king criminal. Why are you treating us like criminals?’” Garcia said in an interview with the Reformer. Officers handcuffed him, searched him and put him in the back of a squad car. Garcia started kicking the back partition in frustration. Lehner, who declined to comment through his lawyer, would later tell investigators he opened the back door because he was worried Garcia would hurt himself. Then, according to Lehner’s account, Garcia aimed a kick at him and Lehner reacted with a defensive kick meant for his chest but which hit Garcia in the face. When investigators interviewed the five other officers on the scene, none of them said they saw Lehner’s kick, not even Lehner’s partner who was going through Garcia’s possessions on the trunk of the squad car. When police dropped Garcia off at the hospital, Lehner’s partner Steve Wuorinen told the nurse that Garcia fell and “his face hit concrete,” according Wuorin to Hennepin County Medical Center records. Years later, Wuorinen and Lehner would offer up the theory that the Wuorin handcuffed Garcia could have knocked his own teeth out when he was thrashing in the back of the squad car. “I believe he did it when he was banging his head in the car,” Lehner told investigators in 2017, according to the disciplinary file. “There is no way you can convince me that a front push-kick, even to someone’s face, can kick their teeth out.” 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 3/24 Lehner was speaking from some experience, having previously been disciplined for excessive force including at least one instance of kicking a suspect. But there’s no video evidence to corroborate Lehner’s story. He had a dash camera, but he didn’t turn it on when he confronted Garcia. When investigators pressed Lehner on his theory — that Garcia knocked his own teeth out — he told them: “I said what I did and I said where I hit him. Do you know how easy it could have been for me because I knew it was not on the video just to lie?” … Medaria Arradondo, then-Deputy Police Chief, speaks with people outside of the 4th Precinct Police Station after 5 people were shot at a Black Lives Matters protest November 24, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Numerous lawsuits, independent investigations and the disciplinary files obtained by the Reformer show a pattern of mismanagement when it comes to holding officers accountable. Department leaders are routinely blind to numerous warning signs that problem officers pose a danger to the public. Managers are often unaware their subordinates are being investigated for misconduct, promoting them through their ranks and lauding them for their aggressive tactics even as complaints pile up. Only when officers commit the most egregious acts of abuse — like Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd’s neck until he died, or Mohamed Noor fatally shooting Justine Damond when she called 911 for help — are they removed from the force. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 4/24 City data on police misconduct is often disorganized and contradictory. The city’s website says there are 301 open cases alleging misconduct by Minneapolis police officers, although a spreadsheet obtained from the city and dated earlier this month showed there are 242 open complaints against 176 officers. The Civil Rights Department, Police Department, and city communications office did not provide an explanation for these discrepancies. Many of these complaints may very well turn out to be illegitimate once they’re investigated. Most will not result in discipline. Just 2.7% of complaints of police misconduct have resulted in disciplinary action between 2013 and 2019. But if the past is any guide, cases of egregious misconduct are also among them. A Flourish data visualization Even as successive mayors and police chiefs have promised transparency and reform, the department has maintained its staunch resistance to outside oversight. It obfuscates and delays information requests from City Council members, civilian oversight committees and journalists, and disciplines officers who speak to the press with the swiftness that police reform advocates wish they would impose on officers who brutalize citizens. About six months before Floyd’s death, a Reformer contributor filed a public records request for all disciplinary records of the city’s roughly 800 officers, which are public under state law. But it took a lawsuit for the city to provide even a single document. Although the 195 files eventually provided by the city are just a fraction of the disciplinary incidents, they show a department that is slow to address accusations of abuse, often taking years to mete out a letter of reprimand or week’s suspension without retraining or other corrective actions. The documents detail officers failing to report beating suspects, fighting in bars, yelling racial slurs and sexually harassing domestic abuse victims. There’s Officer Heather Sterzinger, who in 2012 roused a woman who had passed out in the atrium of her own apartment building with a pressure point maneuver, according to disciplinary documents. Sterzinger allegedly kneeled on the woman’s back until she couldn’t breathe and then dragged her out by her handcuffs. Sterzinger then pulled down the woman’s dress so one of her breasts was exposed as she was put into the back of a squad car and laughed when the woman asked her dress to be pulled up, according to the documents. Sterzinger never reported her use of force — nor did her partner. The department only investigated after the woman filed a complaint. A year and a half later, Sterzinger was suspended for 10 hours. She is now a sergeant and is also accused in an ongoing lawsuit against the city for creating a hostile work environment for a Japanese-American officer. Then there’s Officer Tyrone Barze, who while working off-duty at a Minneapolis bar in 2014 sprayed the bar manager in the face at close range with a “party can” of chemical irritant intended for crowd control and effective 18-20 feet away, according to department records. The spray hit several other people standing outside the bar. He allegedly told the bar 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 5/24 manager that he would arrest him if he didn’t pay him for his off-duty shift. Nearly three years after the incident, the case was resolved: Barze was suspended for 10 hours and prohibited from working off-duty at places that sell alcohol for 90 days. He is now a sergeant. And there’s Officers Peter Brazeau and Alexander Brown, who in 2016 both punched a handcuffed drunk man in the face, breaking his nose and possibly causing a traumatic brain injury, discipline documents say. The officers also put a spit hood over his face and then an EMT injected him with ketamine; doctors had to intubate him to keep him breathing, according to arbitration documents. When asked at a disciplinary proceeding, Brazeau said he wouldn’t do anything differently. More than two years after the incident, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo fired both the officers. But in the intervening years, they were promoted to training officers, a “mitigating factor” cited by the arbitrator in deciding to overturn their terminations. Brazeau is currently an officer; Brown’s status is unclear. Most people who put on a uniform and head out to patrol do not violate people’s civil rights. “We have 3 to 6% of cops who shouldn’t be cops,” then-Deputy Chief Art Knight said in January — that’s about 25 to 50 officers, based on the size of the department at the time. “We have some members on this department who shouldn’t be here, but the vast majority of them should be here,” Knight said. (Knight was demoted from deputy chief later this year after another instance of being too frank, when he warned that unless the department changed its recruiting practices, it would wind up with “the same old white boys.”) But failing to discipline and terminate problem officers is also a systemic problem in the police department that endangers residents, especially those who are Black, Native and Latino. It forces the city to pay out large settlements and squanders any goodwill earned by good cops. “I don’t think you can work around them. There’s too many opportunities for it to go bad,” said Lucy Gerold, a former Minneapolis Police Department Commander, about problem officers. What we don’t see from the department’s disciplinary files are the part of the iceberg submerged underwater. Only the small percentage of complaints which result in discipline may be viewed by the public under Minnesota’s public records laws. Everything else is kept a secret. The disciplinary records obtained by the Reformer also reveal a pattern in the department of relying on victims or members of the public to file a complaint before it investigates misconduct. Because officers reliably protect one another and fail to report misconduct by their colleagues, that points to an unknown number of abuses, which may only come to light in court. For example, years before Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyd’s neck, he allegedly hit a 14-year-old boy twice with a flashlight and kneeled on his back as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe — but Chauvin’s public file doesn’t include that use of force. The details only became known through an 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 6/24 investigation by the state attorney general, who is prosecuting Chauvin for murder. Since the killing of Floyd, Minneapolis has found itself in a familiar position: apologizing for abuse by one of its officers while blaming forces beyond its control and also promising transformational change. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Arradondo have rolled out a steady stream of reforms for months — some with teeth, some just “shallow remixes of previous reforms” as one council member described them. But they often say their hands are tied, blaming the Minneapolis Police Federation and its arbitration process as the biggest barriers to ridding the department of bad cops, neither of which can be changed without the state Legislature. Gerold disagrees. “There’s been too much put on the union as excuse making,” Gerold said. “People are not willing to look at leadership. And I think it boils down a lot to leadership.” Indeed, the presence of a strong union and arbitration process do not explain why the department is so slow to investigate abuses and make disciplinary decisions. Over the past decade, the department has spent 539 days on average resolving a case from the time it’s opened, according to the disciplinary files reviewed by the Reformer. They also do not explain why department leaders routinely sign off on glowing performance reviews for problem officers, which later bolsters their defense in arbitration. And they don’t explain why the department has reinforced the warrior cop culture by bestowing officers with awards for aggressive tactics which would later put them before a disciplinary panel. The city declined to make Arradondo available for an interview and did not respond to a list of written questions. … 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 7/24 A Minneapolis Police canine unit responded to a call at a convenience store on Nicollet Avenue on March 10, 1998.

OFFICER BLAYNE LEHNER’S only stated work experience when he was hired as a Minneapolis police officer in 1998 was milking cows on a farm in central Minnesota. He had just earned an associate’s degree in law enforcement from Hibbing Community College, where his extracurriculars included martial arts and the law enforcement drill team. He applied to the department in February and was earning $15.25 an hour on the force by December. Lehner was coming onto the department during a period of continued expansion of policing in America. Through the 1980s, the federal government began defunding mental health and other welfare programs, while beefing up local police and equipping them with military training and equipment to fight the “war on drugs.” In 1994, Congress passed the “Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act,” or so-called “Crime Bill,” championed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, approved by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton. Along with funding for 100,000 new police officers, the law ramped up the war on drugs and raised penalties for dozens of offenses. Violent crime was spiking in Minneapolis through the mid-90s, as it was in many other American cities. Grim marketing branded the city as a particularly deadly hellhole: In 1995, a gun store owner in south Minneapolis printed T-shirts reading “Murderapolis, City of Wakes” during a legal fight over zoning with the city. The shirts soon caught the attention of a New York Times writer, giving Minneapolis national notoriety for gun violence. Nowhere was this moniker 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 8/24 so potent as in the Twin Cities and the surrounding suburbs. Two months after the Times story ran, then-Gov. Arne Carlson sent state troopers and helicopters into Minneapolis without warning local officials. “This is a clear case where perception is reality,” he said at the time, warning that Minneapolis’ bad reputation was bad for business. Even as violence dropped through the rest of the decade — following the downward trend nationwide — being unconditionally “tough on crime” was a prerequisite for getting elected.  Police, meanwhile, were increasingly called upon to treat the symptoms of broader social problems like mental illness. In pop culture, too, police were the foot soldiers in the war against America’s social ills: addiction, gun violence and gangs. The television show “COPS” launched on the eve of the ’90s, glorifying the police’s hand-to-hand combat against the collapse of law and order. The Minneapolis Police Department was featured in an early season right before the show went to primetime. COPS only came to an end in the U.S. after Floyd was killed, with Minneapolis bookending one of the longest running TV shows. The show has since resumed production but will reportedly not air in the United States. Through the ’90s and 2000s the Minneapolis Police Department trained its officers to be “warrior cops,” formally with courses like “Weapons of Mass Destruction,” and informally on the streets. Discipline documents reveal that when Chauvin was still a recruit in 2002, he helped arrest three Black men suspected of burglary. One of the men started swearing at Chauvin, so the senior officer, Bill Palmer, hit the brakes, causing one suspect to slam his head into the back of the partition. The man was treated at the hospital and then released after they learned he wasn’t involved in the burglary. Palmer was sent to an anger management evaluation and told he would be suspended for 20 hours if he had any more violations. This was Chauvin’s on-the-job training. In 1998, Human Rights Watch published a report on police brutality in Minneapolis and about a dozen other cities several months before Lehner joined the force. It reads like it could have been published yesterday: “Officers who repeatedly commit human rights violations tend to be a small minority who taint entire police departments but are protected, routinely, by the silence of their fellow officers and by flawed systems of reporting, oversight, and accountability.” The report details cases like those found in the Minneapolis Police Department’s disciplinary records two decades later. Like Michael Lardy and Marvin Schumer, who in 1993 allegedly handcuffed two intoxicated Native American men, stuffed them in the trunk of their 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 9/24 squad car, and drove erratically to knock them around. Even after the city paid out $100,000 to each victim, the cops stayed on the force. The Humans Rights Watch report also details the case of Lt. Mike Sauro, whose name is still invoked to this day when talking about police brutality. Sauro was promoted through the ranks while dozens of complaints of excessive force failed to stick to his record. That included a botched raid Sauro led in 1989, which killed an elderly Black couple when the officers’ flash bang grenade set fire to their house. He cost the city a then-record setting $1 million for kicking and beating a handcuffed college student in the back of a bar while working off duty on New Year’s Eve in 1990. Local and federal prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges, believing a jury wouldn’t convict. But the victim, Craig Mische, brought a civil lawsuit that went to trial. One of many damning details that emerged was that the police department reportedly did not investigate Mische’s complaint because they believed it could hurt the city’s defense in a civil trial. The jury ruled in Mische’s favor and put forth a striking condemnation — not just of Sauro, but of the entire Minneapolis Police Department. They found the city liable for “maintaining a custom of deliberate indifference to complaints about excessive force in the department.” After another incident, the police chief tried to fire Sauro for a second time in 1996 calling him “incompetent, unprofessional and inappropriate, at best. At worst it constituted criminal assault,” according to the Star Tribune. An arbitrator overturned the termination, and like Frey and Arradondo, Chief Robert Olson said the arbitration system was possibly the biggest impediment to accountability. For all the bluster, however, the police department also rewarded Sauro repeatedly. Sauro stayed on the force until 2016. He went on to lead the sex crimes unit, which a Star Tribune investigation found to be alarmingly ineffective in catching, arresting and convicting sexual assault suspects, while at times showing indifference to victims. This is the police department — at once celebrated and attacked for its aggressive tactics — that attracted cops like Lehner and Chauvin. And as they rose through the ranks, they were rewarded for using those same aggressive tactics. The city of Minneapolis faces the same conundrum now. Officers like Lehner and Chauvin — stewed in this culture — went on to perpetuate it, with Lehner serving as a leader in the union and Chauvin as a seasoned training officer. … 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 10/24 A bystander captured video of Minneapolis Police Officer Blayne Lehner appearing to choke a protester in 2012. IT’S UNCLEAR what kind of officer Lehner was at first. The city of Minneapolis provided the Reformer his personnel file, which includes his high school transcripts, application and résumé. But it doesn’t have any unredacted notes of concern or praise for seven years. By 2013, though, there were plenty of warning signs that Lehner was at risk of using excessive force like the kick that would break Luis Garcia’s face. Lehner was named in two federal lawsuits against the city of Minneapolis for excessive force and seen in media reports choking and macing protesters. Within the span of one month in 2012, Lehner was found to have used excessive force three times, including at least one incident in which he kicked a suspect. It’s unclear what sanction was imposed, however, because the city has refused to provide public records for six other incidents in which Lehner was disciplined. The department doesn’t appear to have taken any action to prevent Lehner from kicking future suspects in the face, like the handcuffed Garcia. He wasn’t reassigned or taken off the street, either. To the contrary: Even if his undisciplined use of force was a massive liability, Lehner’s aggressive style was repeatedly praised and rewarded by his colleagues. Around this time, he was elected to a leadership position in the union. In July 2013, Lehner was named 5th Precinct Officer of the Month. In nominating him, his supervisors noted: “He is looked at as a shift leader by the younger Officers on the shift and produces great numbers every month.” The department appeared to have embraced a tradeoff: a few civil rights violations in return for good stats. “Minneapolis in particular has struggled with the tension that every police department has, which is between rewarding the aggressive officers who are out there stopping crime and making sure that police aggression doesn’t cross the constitutional line,” said Eric Hageman, an attorney who represented Garcia in his case against the city. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 11/24 Two months before he would break Garcia’s jaw, Lehner received an “Award of Merit” for tackling an armed suspect and putting him in a chokehold. The city would later ban all chokeholds and neck restraints shortly after Floyd’s death as part of an agreement with the state’s Department of Human Rights, which is currently investigating the Minneapolis Police Department for systemic discriminatory practices against people of color. … THE CLEAREST PATTERN to emerge when examining the disciplinary files is that when a Minneapolis police officer does something wrong, no matter how big or small, other officers on the scene will minimize what happened or report not having seen or heard anything. Just like when Lehner kicked Garcia in the face and the five officers on the scene said they saw nothing, in file after file, officers tell investigators they didn’t see anything. In 2014, a Minneapolis police officer suggested a group of six young East African men were members of Al-Qaeda and called one a “piece of s**t” during an expletive-laced pat down, according to discipline documents. Three witnesses heard it and filed complaints against the officer, including then- Minneapolis Park Board Superintendent Jayne Miller, who was doing a ridealong with Park Police at the time. The officer, Christopher Guelcher, admitted to making a comment about Al-Qaeda and using profanity, but the three other officers on the scene told investigators they didn’t hear a reference to Al-Qaeda. The Office of Police Conduct Review finished its investigation a year after the incident. A year after that, the department issued its discipline recommendation: training related to “Somalian culture” and a suspension, which three years later the union negotiated down to 15 hours. By the time the discipline file was closed — almost five years after the incident — the officer had already been retired for about two years. In another incident in 2014, Officer John Haugland yelled “Get on the f***ing ground,” “I’m gonna f***in kill you” multiple times to a man seen running after hearing gunshots, discipline documents say. After the man was handcuffed, reports say Haugland’s partner Troy Carlson said the man seemed to move suddenly, so Carlson hit him in the head, causing him to fall to the pavement. There were six other officers on the scene; two said they saw Carlson hit the suspect. Both those officers appeared on the squad camera footage, which they reviewed before reporting they had seen Carlson use force. One said it looked like Carlson was trying to push the subject into the back of the squad car. The other said he thought Carlson smacked him in the head to get the suspect’s attention. The victim was let go and not charged with a crime. Carlson was disciplined a year and a half later, although it took nearly three years for the case to be settled after the union appealed. He got a 40-hour suspension, by which time he had been promoted to sergeant. His partner 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 12/24 Haugland was issued a letter of reprimand for swearing nearly two years after the incident. Under new police guidelines created this summer, threatening to use force is considered a use of force. Haugland and Carlson are now both sergeants. In the warrior cop ethos, officers have to protect each other from all danger including unfair censure from Internal Affairs, civilian oversight panels, politicians and the press, who just don’t understand the job. “When I’m on the street and I’m in uniform, everybody’s got to have my back because I could be the next one at the end of someone’s gun,” said Gerold, the retired police commander. “And there’s something that starts to happen that crosses the line into not telling the truth … It’s a problem, and I don’t have a good answer for it.” The blue wall of silence also extends to some sergeants and lieutenants, members of the same union as the rank-and-file but whom they are supposed to be holding accountable. For example, Sgt. Richard Altonen arrived on the scene where Lehner kicked Garcia to review the use of force. Altonen, a former Internal Affairs investigator, didn’t report seeing anything concerning despite the bloodied teenager. In 2002, then-Sgt. Bob Kroll, now president of the police union, failed to report for nearly two weeks that an officer under his supervision drunkenly fired his weapon over the head of another officer at a shift party. Kroll was demoted for 90 days, according to discipline documents. The city did not provide the investigatory file related to this incident, and it’s unclear if it was challenged by the union. In another case from 2015, a police officer hit a fleeing suspect with his squad car. The officer reported his use of force to his supervisor, Sgt. Christie Nelson. But in her report, Nelson wrote that the suspect tripped on his untied shoes, hit a tree and ricocheted onto the squad car. A complaint was filed against Nelson. That set in motion a nearly two-year- long investigation, despite a camera in the squad car capturing the conversation Nelson had with her subordinate, in which he told her he hit the suspect with his car. There is also footage of the arrest captured on a dash cam — footage that Nelson did not review before advancing the theory that the suspect fell out of his shoes, according to disciplinary documents. Nelson was ultimately suspended for 10 hours without pay. Nelson is now a lieutenant. The blue wall of silence is paradoxical: Police rely on truth-telling witnesses to solve crimes, but they adhere to rigid omertà when it comes to their own. And most rank-and-file officers don’t like dealing with bad cops. ”Good cops want good discipline,” said Gerold, the retired police commander. “They don’t like officers getting away with bullsh**t.” 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 13/24 The most effective inoculation against the blue wall of silence has been body cameras. “Having video footage changes the game. We’ve seen that over and over again, from Rodney King to George Floyd,” said Hageman, Garcia’s attorney. “Before we had body camera footage, we always needed to have some independent witness because we can almost never win a case where it’s our client’s word against the police’s word, because the police are always going to back each other up.” But body cameras are far from a cure-all for police accountability. After they were introduced in Minneapolis in 2016, officers rarely turned them on, making them little better than a $400 brooch. An internal audit found that in the first year of use, police officers were turning their body cameras on when they were required to just 65% of the time. The department’s SWAT team officers were not using body cameras at all. The reason for the infrequent use, according to the audit, was that officers had broad discretion in deciding when to use them. There was also a glaring management problem detailed in the audit: Supervisors were supposed to review video recordings to ensure officers were using body cameras, but failed to do so. What forced a change to the department’s body camera policy was the 2017 killing of Justine Damond, who called 911 to report a possible assault and then was shot by former Officer Mohamed Noor. Neither Noor nor his partner had their dash camera or body cameras turned on at the time of the shooting. After that, Arradondo changed the policy to require officers to turn on their cameras for any police-related activity, in line with what the city’s civilian oversight commission had recommended two years before Damond’s killing, before the city adopted the cameras department-wide. Police use of body cameras has steadily risen since, with compliance today estimated to be around 95%. Despite early troubles with compliance, just one officer has ever been disciplined for not turning on her body camera, according to city data. Heather Sterzinger, the same officer accused of roughing up a drunk woman, received a letter of reprimand 20 months after not turning on her body camera in a different incident. Research suggests body cameras make police officers more honest. A recent study of officers in New York found those with body cameras reported 40% more stops, likely because officers are more inclined to document their work if they know they’re being recorded. And yet, body camera footage is often only reviewed if a complaint triggers an investigation. As in the case with Chauvin and the 14-year-old boy he knelt on 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 14/24 for 17 minutes, officers’ reports may not trigger review of bodycam video or further investigation. As part of Minneapolis’s legal agreement with the state’s Department of Human Rights, police officers are required to report unauthorized use of force they see, and body camera footage may be audited by the city’s Office of Police Conduct Review, an agency within the city’s Department of Civil Rights that investigates some allegations of police misconduct. Although body cameras should make disciplinary investigations easier and more accurate, they haven’t shortened the length of investigations in Minneapolis. Fewer than a dozen cases from 2017 had been resolved by the end of 2019, according to city data. The use of “coaching” provides another crypt into which citizen complaints against the Police Department can be disposed of. The city has said the practice of diverting complaints into retraining opportunities — which keeps the matter off the discipline books – is only used for minor policy violations, like speeding and inappropriate language, allowing the city to prioritize more severe incidents for investigation. But city records reveal that coaching has been used in allegations involving excessive force, failure to provide protection, discrimination, and police retaliation and harassment. The specifics of the allegations — and the names of the officers involved — aren’t revealed to the public, however, because the city considers coaching a “non-disciplinary” outcome. “I don’t think anyone is going to have a problem with low-level problems being sent to coaching, particularly because it is likely very effective,” said Andrew Gordon, deputy director for community legal services at The Legal Rights Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit. “But some of the things that we’re seeing getting referred [to coaching] are not low-level offenses.” Abigail Cerra, a lawyer who joined the city’s Police Conduct Oversight Commission, earlier this year, said it’s unclear what coaching involves. “It was a really difficult process to find out what coaching is,” Cerra said. “I couldn’t get staff to answer my questions, people started shutting me down, and no one wanted to talk to me.” After Cerra drafted a report making the case that complaints which result in coaching are discipline and thus public information, the city attorney issued a memorandum stating that the department can withhold coaching data because it’s merely a spontaneous informal conversation with a supervisor. But Cerra said there’s nothing spontaneous about a formal complaint being lodged against a police officer. Cerra said many complainants receive a letter stating their complaint has been closed with no discipline. “If I were a complainant, I would think nothing happened,” Cerra said. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 15/24 Some attorneys have also expressed concern that since discipline files of an officer involved in a case must be disclosed to the defense, the use of coaching conceals from them an unknowable amount of misconduct. “When the city aids in that failure to disclose by  hiding these disciplinary decisions it undeniably contributes to the perversion of our criminal legal system,” said Gordon in a September letter to the city, which was co-signed by several civil rights and racial justice organizations. Imani Jaafar, who heads the Office of Police Conduct Review, referred an interview request to interim civil rights director Frank Reed, who did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. … Police prepare to open fire with tear gas and non-lethal rounds on a group of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd while he was in police custody on May 29, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images. UNDISCIPLINED BEHAVIOR on the part of some rank-and-file officers and lack of accountability from Minneapolis Police Department management was abundantly clear in George Floyd’s May 25 death and its aftermath. After Chauvin ignored Floyd’s pleas for his life on camera, protests swelled. Arrandondo told the press, “I directed our folks to practice restraint. That meant, quite frankly, that a building was significantly damaged. But I’d rather have that than our officers being involved in an encounter where either they get hurt physically or a person from our community gets hurt.” And yet, scattered instances of a thrown water bottle at police were met with rubber bullets fired indiscriminately into crowds, permanently blinding a journalist in one eye and at least one demonstrator. A group of reporters and another group of protestors have filed class action lawsuits. The police also sprayed chemical irritants without provocation, including a now-infamous incident of an officer spraying peaceful protesters with mace from the driver’s window of a squad car. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 16/24 Unchecked behavior of officers — coupled with a failure to arrest violent agitators — escalated tensions to potentially deadly levels for protesters and police alike. As protests turned to riots, the mayor ordered police to abandon the Third Precinct to avoid loss of life; officers retreated behind the remaining police stations, barricaded as people from across the region set fire to the city. Meanwhile, Kroll flexed the union’s muscle when he sent a letter to the rank- and-file amid the riots blasting Frey and Gov. Tim Walz and hinting he would form an alliance with state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, to take control of the National Guard, a brazen act that illustrated his own perceived influence. On June 10, Arradondo said he was withdrawing from contract negotiations with the police union, which had come to be seen as the biggest institutional barrier to reform, blocking new policies and protecting problem cops under the banner of organized labor. But in fact, just the chief withdrew, since ending negotiations would have exposed the city to potential labor lawsuits. Arradondo also said the Police Department would adopt a system that alerts supervisors to complaints against an officer, as the U.S. Department of Justice recommended in 2015. He argued it would put the department at the vanguard of policing, and give supervisors the tools to intervene before an officer could act as Chauvin did when he kneeled on Floyd’s neck. “For the first time in the history of policing, we here in Minneapolis will have an opportunity to use real-time data and automation to intervene with officers who are engaged in problematic behavior,” he told reporters. The implication was that the department’s leaders didn’t yet have the ability to keep track of patterns that signal trouble: multiple use of force complaints; fights outside the job; even prosaic signals like being late for work could all indicate a troubled officer. “There have been questions raised about when an incident occurs, ‘Well, Chief Rondo, how come you didn’t know about this person and this number of complaints?’ and what have you. We need to reevaluate that. We need to do it with real-time data,” Arradondo said. Early intervention systems aren’t new. They’ve been around for more than three decades, and aren’t new to the Minneapolis Police Department, which started such a system in 2009. But police sergeants and other supervisors didn’t use it, so there was little data to analyze, according to the 2015 Department of Justice report. Arrandondo knows this history well because he’s seen the department’s flawed disciplinary system up close for more than two decades. Even as the Minneapolis Police Department rewarded problem white officers with promotions and awards, Black officers accused the department of unfairly 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 17/24 meting out discipline. Arradondo was one of five Black officers to sue the department in 2007 for discrimination. The lawsuit details how a Black precinct inspector was demoted for allegedly driving a squad car under the influence, and he was replaced by Sauro, the white cop who had been disciplined and sued multiple times for brutality. The city settled the suit in 2009 for $740,000, and then, in 2013, then-Chief Janeé Harteau tapped Arradondo to lead the Internal Affairs Unit, overseeing the department’s investigations into officer misconduct. In 2014, the Department of Justice under President Barack Obama reviewed Minneapolis Police Department’s early intervention system and its other oversight processes and found them failing. The DOJ also reported the department’s primary intervention was to refer officers to “coaching.” Even though Arradondo claimed in 2020 that the new early warning system would be a critical management tool, he sought funding through a philanthropic foundation, not the police budget. The philanthropy pulled out and again the program stalled. It resurfaced this month during budget negotiations. The chief insisted the program had to be separated from discipline in order to be effective. Setting aside the lack of a real-time data system, supervisors often don’t know their subordinates have any complaints against them. One Minneapolis supervisor said they aren’t told about one of their officers being disciplined until after it happens — sometimes years after the event. “Every cop could have two or three complaints ongoing against them. And I’d know nothing about it. No one tells us,” said a current Minneapolis Police Department supervisor, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Picture a school district in which a principal doesn’t know a teacher is under investigation for poor performance, racial bias against a student, or sexual harassment. The same police source says the department also fails to adequately train new sergeants and lieutenants in holding their officers accountable. “Our department does a terrible job of training supervisors how to be supervisors,” the source said. Sergeants and lieutenants also don’t have much authority to hold their officers accountable. They can’t issue a suspension or letter of reprimand, for instance, a fact that’s used to keep them in the same bargaining unit as patrol officers. What they can do is write reports, and wait for the chief to make a decision. … 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 18/24 Security video show Minneapolis Police Officer Blayne Lehner pushing a woman down in her apartment building in August 2014. His termination for the use of force would be overturned by an arbitrator. THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT didn’t begin investigating Blayne Lehner for breaking Luis Garcia’s face until nearly two years after it happened, and not until Garcia filed a lawsuit against the city. Garcia first had to clear up the charge against him for underage drinking — the only criminal conviction to come out of that traffic stop. “Someone who is the victim of police excessive force often has to play defense before they can go on offense,” Hageman, Garcia’s lawyer, said, “And that was the case here.” For weeks after his arrest, Garcia’s jaw was wired shut and he could only eat food his mom liquefied in the blender. He lost his job as a forklift driver because he couldn’t leave the house. Doctors also performed multiple root canals because the kick or kicks to Garcia’s face not only knocked out his top two teeth but killed his bottom front teeth as well, he said. Even with multiple pain medications, he could still feel throbbing pain in his face. Sleeping was no less painful. “I had nightmares about getting arrested again and having my teeth ripped out. And then I’d wake up and my teeth were ripped out,” Garcia said. Doctors recommended dental implants for his two front teeth, which he couldn’t afford because he was uninsured. “My sister was working two jobs at the time, and my mom was taking care of me,” Garcia said. In that time, Lehner stayed on the street but soon became the subject of another excessive force allegation. While responding to a call of a domestic dispute between two women in August 2014, Lehner pushed one of the women down twice, slapped her 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 19/24 phone out of her hand while she was talking to 911 dispatch and allegedly called her a “c**t.” Lehner denied to investigators that he ever used that word, according to discipline documents. The woman was drunk and acting aggressive, Lehner would tell investigators, although he said he did not feel personally threatened. He didn’t arrest her. He never filed a use of force report, but an investigation was opened two days later because the property manager saw the footage on the building’s surveillance tape. She demanded a meeting with Lehner’s supervisor, saying it was the second time in the past week a resident had told her an officer called them a “c**t.” “One of my big issues is, these officers … come to my building, are rude to me, rude to my residents and don’t actually take care of the issue they were called for,” Alyssa Kiffmeyer wrote in an email to Minneapolis sergeants at the 5th precinct. The Office of Police Conduct Review finished its 75-page investigation into the incident some 14 months later in October 2015. By then, the city had just started its investigation into Lehner kicking Garcia and had put him on paid administrative leave the month prior. Harteau, who was then the chief, terminated Lehner in January 2016. Lehner appealed his termination for pushing and swearing at the woman, which went to arbitration. The arbitrator, Stephen Befort, overturned the termination and reduced it to a 40-hour suspension, reasoning that Lehner’s behavior wasn’t egregious enough for termination given his relatively clean disciplinary record. The department had paused its investigation into Lehner’s use of force against Garcia, so the arbitrator wasn’t able to consider that event in making his decision. Harteau issued a statement blasting the arbitrator’s decision saying, “These rulings hinder my ability, as a Police Chief, to create an effective culture of accountability within the Department.” Shortly after Floyd’s death, Arradondo echoed his predecessor: “There is nothing more debilitating,” he said, than when an arbitrator “not only allows for that employee to be back on your department but to be patrolling in your communities.” Police officers who are terminated are reinstated a little less than half the time through arbitration — about the same rate for other public employees — but the disciplinary cases that make it to arbitration are rare. Despite their rarity, city and police department leaders blame arbitration for dragging out disciplinary cases and reversing disciplinary decisions. 2/25/2021 The Bad Cops: How Minneapolis protects its worst police officers until it’s too late - Minnesota Reformer https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/12/15/the-bad-cops-how-minneapolis-protects-its-worst-police-officers-until-its-too-late/ 20/24 Critics also say arbitrators are prone to a “meet in the middle” resolution, which winds up favoring the police union. But the Minneapolis Police Department often fails to show arbitrators that problem officers have a history of misconduct. In one case, an arbitrator reduced the discipline of a police sergeant for sexually harassing his subordinate because the department couldn’t show he had the pattern of abuse they said he did. A female police officer reported Sgt. Kent Warnberg for allegedly making inappropriate sexual comments to her on two separate occasions in 2013, according to the disciplinary files. Eleven months after the incident was reported, Harteau issued her disciplinary decision, which was later reduced to a 90-day demotion by the arbitrator. In explaining her decision, Harteau wrote, “During my review I learned this complaint was not the first incident of inappropriate conduct.” The arbitrator notes, however, “No evidence of prior disciplinary action or corrective action appears on the grievant’s record.” In fact, this is the only case of discipline against Warnberg in his more than three decades on the Minneapolis police force, although he was convicted in Wisconsin of sexually assaulting a private at a National Guard training in 1992 while he was a captain. He was reinstated to the police force. Warnberg said he couldn’t remember making any such comments but stopped short of denying it, according to disciplinary documents. Of the 10 Minneapolis Police employees who were interviewed, only one said they might have heard anything. Warnberg retired earlier this year. The department also often fails to show that they’re not disciplining an officer more harshly than others. The union frequently argues there’s been “disparate treatment,” pointing to officers who’ve only received a letter of reprimand for kicking suspects, for example. “In my view, it is a problem with inconsistent management,” said labor expert Joe Slater. While disparate treatment arguments are meant to ensure police officers are treated fairly, they can also cement a bad precedent. If the department hasn’t consistently fired officers for kicking handcuffed suspects in the face or sexually harassing a subordinate, the union may successfully argue that the officer must be treated like others. And then that officer receives a lesser punishment, which is used as a precedent the next time an officer comes before an arbitrator for a similar offense. And so the snake goes on eating its own tail. Department leaders blame the union and arbitration for being time consuming, even though litigating employment disputes before a judge and'"

Copies of these documents were  obtained and Body Worn Camera (BWC) videos from the officers involved were reviewed. The complaint  was assigned for investigation on July 10, 2017. The Complainant was interviewed and her statement  recorded on August 15, 2017.  On March 19, 2018, this office received from Edina Police Department a CD disc containing several files:  audio of (2) phone calls between Minneapolis dispatch and Edina Dispatch, redacted transcription of (2)  9-1-1 calls, and a redacted Event Report #2017-050454.  13.43 - Personnel Data  On May 4, 2018, emails were sent to Officer 13.43  13.43 and Sgt. Shannon Barnette, informing  them that they had been scheduled to appear at the Office of Police Conduct Review to provide  statements in this matter. On May 8, 2018, the investigator received a voice message from Assistant City  Attorney Brian Carter. He said that he was representing Sgt. Barnette in a lawsuit brought by the  complainant in this matter. The investigator spoke with Mr. Carter on May 8, 2018, and Mr. Carter stated  that both Sgt.

Barnette said, \"People who act like  this don\\'t call 9-1-1 a million times, they don\\'t call Edina PD.\"  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy then explained that she has a vulnerable adult PPI in Edina about whom she  was concerned. Sgt. Barnette then said, \"Well, I\\'m thinking that maybe you\\'re in crisis today.\"  then said she thought that the officers were there in retaliation for a complaint she  made earlier in the day regarding a lack of police response to a call about someone smoking  marijuana on her property. She again re-stated that she was not in a mental health crisis and Sgt.  Barnette said they were going to have her checked out at the hospital. Privacy Policy then stated,  \"I\\'m not a danger to myself or anybody else.\"  Privacy Policy  Page 4 of 27  1332754 Sgt.

When the ambulance arrived, Privacy Policy was allowed to walk to the ambulance and she is seen  exiting the front door. Sgt. Barnette and Officer 13.43 then attempted to put the screen back  onto the storm door, but were not successful. Sgt. Barnette then instructed Officer 13.43 to  create a forced entry report and document the damage to the screen. Sgt. Barnette placed the  screen inside Privacy Policy residence before Officer 13.43 turned off his camera.  **The elapsed time from first contact between the officers and Privacy Policy to the time that  they physically took control of her and informed her she would have to be \"checked out\" was  3:05 minutes. Total amount of time Privacy Policy was directly observed by the officers before she  was physically restrained and informed she would have to \"checked out\" was 39 seconds.

This call was a transferred  call from Edina PD. She said that she believed the individual was smoking marijuana and she  asked that police officers respond to contact this person. Privacy Policy did request to speak with  the officers when they arrive. Officers (Squad 504) were dispatched to this call at 10:16 hours  Privacy Policy  Page 6 of 27  1332756 and arrived at 10:17 hours.

Privacy Policy was also upset as she complained that no  officers responded to her earlier 9-1-1 call. The call taker told her that officers were sent on the  first call and Privacy Policy said she was home and she wasn\\'t contacted. She asked that the  Precinct Commander call her right away. The call taker said he didn\\'t have the commander\\'s  direct number but he\\'d have the sergeant call her. The call taker also informed Privacy Policy that  the officers who were just there were sent to contact her based on a call from an anonymous  relative. Privacy Policy was still angry at the end of the call and the call taker said he would have  the Sergeant call her.8 3.

Privacy Policy further alleged, \"...a physician acknowledged that I was being illegally detained and  released me. I was forced to walk home two miles in the middle of the night.\"  Privacy Policy was interviewed regarding her complaint on August 15, 2017. She briefly discussed the first  time Officer 13.43 and Officer 13.43 arrived at her home. She said it was about 8:20 p.m. and she asked  them if they were there regarding her call to 9-1-1 earlier in the day14 for a person sitting on the retaining  wall in the alley behind her home and whom she believed was smoking marijuana. They told her they did  not know about that call and they were there about \"a cousin and threats, but they weren\\'t giving me  any details.\"15 She said she asked who called and Officer 13.43 went back to the squad car. When he  returned to the front door, he apologized and they left. Privacy Policy said she called 9-1-1 after the  officers left to complain about being harassed at her home.16 Privacy Policy stated that, at about 9:40 to 9:45 p.m., she \"heard a commotion at my front door...I had the  screen door locked and the front wooden door locked and observed three Minneapolis police officers  breaking down the door of my home.\"1-7 She asked them what they were doing and they continued to  \"break down the door.\" Privacy Policy said she closed the door and called 9-1-1 for help, but the officers  \"pounded on the door\"18. When she opened the door again, the officers \"charged into my home...Two of  them assaulted me.\"1° Privacy Policy further stated, \"They proceeded to make nonsensical statements.  Barnette said I had called 9-1-1 a million times, quote, end quote. Um, and, ah, was, um, telling me that  she had decided I was in a mental health crisis.\"20 Privacy Policy said she was taken to Fairview Southdale Hospital where she was seen by a doctor. He asked  her a few questions before he released her. She left the hospital around midnight and she then had to  walk home.  During her statement, Privacy Policy denied calling anyone and making threats against them. She stated, \"I  didn\\'t threaten anybody at any point in time on May 25th or any other date. Period.\"2\\'  Privacy Policy was asked about the phone conversation she had with Sgt. Barnette prior to the three  officers coming to her home and placing her on a hold. She said this conversation occurred after she  called 9-1-1 following her contact with Officers 13.43 and 13.43 (the 8:21 p.m. call). Regarding this  conversation, Privacy Policy said Sgt. Barnette \"seemed totally uninterested and dismissive of any concerns  that I had. Rude. Unresponsive.\"22 When asked if Sgt. Barnette asked her any questions about her specific  state of mind at that time, Privacy Policy simply said, \"No.\"23 Privacy Policy  Edina PD.  was also asked about the 9-1-1 calls she made during which she asked to be transferred to  Privacy Policy stated:  \"I called.

Specifically, the hospital report states that in relay, in  regard to me, quote: her apartment was a mess and so they were concerned about whether she  could take care of herself.  \"My closest friends tease me mercilessly about the fact that you could eat off the floors at my  house.

Fairview Southdale Hospital denies that, ah, they had any  information to make such a bizarre statement and, ah, speculated that the people who dumped  me there were looking for any reason whatsoever to justify their conduct. That\\'s the kind of  bizarre misstatements that have been made in this case.\" 26 As mentioned above in the discussion of the BWC videos, Officer 13.43  BWC captured some footage  showing the interior of Privac Polic home, including the living room area, the upstairs office, and the  statement above in her depiction of the  kitchen. This video footage appears to corroborate  condition of her home.  Medical Records  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy  was admitted into the hospital at 10:14 P.M. She was evaluated by Doctor Robert James  Anderson in the Emergency Department and discharged to go home at 12:46 A.M. The following  information was included in the medical report under the heading \"Medical Decision Making\":  \"The patient is brought in by police on a hold. She was very angry with the staff. I saw the patient  and she was very angry with me as well. I explained to the patient the process of police officer  holds and the need to undergo medical screening to make sure that there is no significant acute  medical or mental health disorder requiring admission the hospital. Although there may be  underlying mental health disorders in this patient with a history of depression and anxiety, there  may be component of some paranoid behavior, but after spending approximately 20 minutes  with the patient, she was somewhat rational and I do not believe that the patient is hold-able.  The pt admitted to drinking earlier and does have a legal amount of alcohol in her system now  and this may have contributed the the circumstances earlier. The patient elected to go home. She  did not want to be admitted to the hospital. Again, she did not have any medical concerns that  she wanted me to address. No trauma to suggest intracranial bleed; no headache, no focal neuro  deficit etc.\" 27 DISCUSSION  Allegation 1  The Minneapolis Police Department\\'s Policy and Procedure Manual states in part:  5-103 USE OF DISCRETION  The police profession is one that requires officers to use considerable judgment and discretion in  the performance of their daily duties. Officers have a large body of knowledge from Department  25 Patient Medical Report, Privacy Policy dated 05/25/2017, Page 5, \"Medical Decision Making\", Line 3  26 Ibid, Page 10 lines 9-22  27 Ibid., Page 5, \"Medical Decision Making\", paragraph 2  Page 9 of 27  1332759 policies and procedures, training, their own professional police experience and the experiences  of their fellow officers to guide them in exercising proper judgment and discretion in situations  not specifically addressed by Department rules and regulations. In addition, officers must always  adhere to the following principles in the course of their employment with the Minneapolis Police  Department:  •  POLICE ACTION - LEGALLY JUSTIFIED: Officers must act within the limits of their authority as  defined by law and judicial interpretation, thereby ensuring that the constitutional rights of  individuals and the public are protected. All investigative detentions, pedestrian and vehicle  stops, arrests, searches and seizures of property by officers will be based on a standard of  reasonable suspicion or probable cause in accordance with the Fourth Amendment of the  U.S. Constitution and statutory authority. Officers must be able to articulate specific facts,  circumstances and conclusions that support reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  (11/17/15)  •  EQUALITY OF ENFORCEMENT: Officers shall provide fair and impartial law enforcement to all  citizens.  •  LOYALTY: Officers shall be faithful to their oath of office, strive to uphold the principles of  professional police service, and advance the mission of the Department.  5-105  PROFESSIONAL CODE OF CONDUCT (01/05/16)  A. General  4.  Employees shall use reasonable judgment in carrying out their duties and  responsibilities. They need to weigh the consequences of their actions. (04/01/05)  (05/03/05) (01/05/16)  Privacy Policy alleged that the officers in this matter forced entry into her home and had her taken to a  hospital for mental health evaluation without justification. Officer 13.43 and Officer  13.43  both  indicate in their reports that the decision to place a mental health hold on Privacy Policy was made by Sgt.  Barnette, prior to arriving at Privac Polic residence.28 Since Sgt. Barnette did not complete a CAPRS  supplement report (discussed below under Allegation 3), there is no articulation of \"specific facts,  circumstances, and conclusions\" in the CAPRS report to support the actions that Sgt. Barnette directed to  be taken in this matter.  Minnesota Statute 253B.05, Subd. 2. states, \"A peace or health officer may take a person into custody  and transport the person to a licensed physician or treatment facility if the officer has reason to believe,  either through direct observation of the person\\'s behavior, or upon reliable information of the person\\'s  recent behavior and knowledge of the person\\'s past behavior or psychiatric treatment, that the person is  mentally ill or developmentally disabled and in danger of injuring self or others if not immediately  detained.\" The statute also states, \"The peace or health officer shall make written application for  admission of the person to the treatment facility. The application shall contain the peace or health  officer\\'s statement specifying the reasons for and circumstances under which the person was taken into  custody. If danger to specific individuals is a basis for the emergency hold, the statement must include  identifying information on those individuals, to the extent practicable.\"  28 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1, paragraph 4 and Supplement 2, paragraph 3, line 6, [3]  Page 10 of 27  1332760 The Minneapolis Police Department\\'s Policy and Procedure Manual states in part:  7-1003  MENTALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS (05/06/15)  Felony suspects who are mentally impaired shall be booked in the jail unless otherwise ordered  by a superior officer. Officers booking a mentally impaired person shall advise the jail and the  applicable investigating unit.  Officers dealing with disturbed mentally impaired persons have the authority to transport and  hold them pending a medical/ psychological review by a physician as mandated by the  Hospitalization and Commitment Act of the Minnesota Statutes (Minn. Stat. 2538.0552&3).  Officers attempting to use the powers granted by this law shall be familiar with its  requirements. (07/28/89)  Officer  13.43  Officer 13 43 :  Officer 13.43 was partnered with Officer 13.43 on 05/25/2017, in Squad 530. He was not deposed in  the civil action filed by Privacy Policy and he was not available for an interview due to his employment  status following this incident. He completed a supplement report to the CAPRS report which was filed in  this matter.29 In his report, Officer 13.43 wrote that Officer 13.43 and he were dispatched to  after an anonymous male caller requested officers to check on Privacy Policy welfare. Officer  that the male caller alleged that Privacy Policy had placed a threatening phone call to him. Officer  report does not contain any facts or details relevant to the alleged threats, nor does the report list the  identity of the male caller. Officer 13.43 stated in his report that they arrived at Privac Polic residence  at 19:38 hours. This appears to be incorrect as VisiNet lists the time they were assigned to the call at  20:05 hours, arriving on scene at 20:14.  Privac Polic  13.43  home  wrote  13.43  Officer 13.43 wrote that Privacy Policy was \"agitated and uncooperative,\" asking the officers why they  were at her property. Officer 13.43 said he attempted to calm  Privacy Policy down; however, she  continued to shout at them. He wrote that the remarks in the call were related to a male, so they  apologized and cleared the call. The VisiNet report shows 20:26 hours as the time that the call was  completed.3°  Officer  to  13.43 Supplement report lists two different times that Officer 13.43 and he were dispatched  Privacy Policy home for the second time. In his second paragraph, he wrote:  Privacy Policy  \"At approx. 21:23 hours, we were dispatched to Check Welfare at  In paragraph seven, he wrote:  \"5/25/201721:34 hours, we were dispatched for the second time (17-191393).\"  The information given in paragraph seven appears to list the time incorrectly. The VisiNet Incident Detail  Report for this call states that officers were assigned to the call at 21:23 hours.31 Officer 13.43 wrote, \"Prior to arriving, Sgt. Barnette had advised my partner and Ito place a Health and  Welfare hold on OT ppi \" 32 He also wrote, \"Prior to our arrival we requested EMS and they staged  a block away.\" 33 This information is corroborated by the comments entered into the VisiNet Incident  Detail Report, which state:  29 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1  3° VisiNet Incident Detail Report #17-191155  31 VisiNet Incident Detail Report #17-191393  32 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1, paragraph 3  33 Ibid, paragraph 7  Page 11 of 27  1332761 5/25/2017  21:05:53  CT031779  Response  [3] PER SGT BARNETTE SQD 502 - OFCRS TO SIGN A  HEALTH AND WELFARE HOLD ON THIS SUBJECT - SGT  BARNETTE HAS ALSO  SPOKEN W/THERESA AND ATTEMPTED TO ADVISE HER  5/25/2017  21:06:11  CT031779  Response  [4] **OFCRS TO SIGN HEALTH/WELFARE HOLD PER  502\"\"  5/25/2017  21:26:26  530  Response  [7] START EMS CODE 2 PLZ...

Barnette  Following his statement that they were dispatched for the second time, Officer 13.43 paraphrased  comments from the VisiNet report into his supplement. He wrote that, since the first incident,  appeared to be getting more and more agitated making numerous calls to dispatch and not  making sense. He added that she appeared to be in a \"mild manic state\", information which is not stated  in VisiNet and which he had not yet had the opportunity to observe for himself.35 After knocking on the  door, Privacy Policy opened the door and appeared \"angry and agitated.\" She then slammed the door and  asked them to leave. At that point Sgt. Barnette removed the screen from the screen door and knocked  until Privacy Policy opened the door. Officer 13.43 report does not contain any information about the  officers entering Privacy Policy home and physically restraining her.  PPI  PPI  Paragraph 8 appears to contain Officer 13.43 reasoning for placing Privacy Policy on a mental health hold.  He referred to Privacy Policy \"thought pattern\" as being \"scattered\". He wrote that she \"kept referring to  her cousin in Edina who was being \\'financially exploited—. She \"uttered\" that she sent an email to  Inspector Waite and Mayor Hodges. She lived alone. He summed it up, writing, \"Upon assessing the  situation, we determine to place OT  PPI  on a health and wellness hold. Primary due to OT/  mild manic and agitated state at the moment she was unable to care for herself.\"36 PPI  This supplement report does not address the statutory requirement that an officer must have a reason to  believe \"that the person is mentally ill or developmentally disabled and in danger of injuring self or others  if not immediately detained.\" 37 Officer 13.43  13.43  Officer 13.43 is listed in the CAPRS report as the reporting officer. The report is coded for a Forced  Entry Report as well as Crisis Intervention. The Public Data statement on page one states:  \"Officers responded to the above location for a check the welfare. Per shift Sgt, squad 502, OT1  was placed on a hold. She was transported to the Hospital by the Ambulance (Run # 17037649).\"  38  Officer 13.43 also completed a supplement report for this incident. In this supplement report, she  included some of the text of the VisiNet Incident Detail Report, which discussed prior responses to her  home on that date. This data states that the officers responding to Privacy Policy home were directed by  Sgt. Barnette to sign a health and welfare hold on Privacy Policy . This data also states that some member  of Privac Polic family called Edina PD, who in turn called Minneapolis Police Department, to say that  she may fight with police.39 34 VisiNet Incident Detail Report #17-191393  35 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Supplement 1, paragraph 7  36 Ibid, paragraph 8  37 Minnesota Statute 253B.05, Subd. 2.  38 MPD CAPRS CCN #17-191393, Page 1, Public Data  39 Ibid, Supplement 2, paragraph 3  Page 12 of 27  1332762 Officer 13.43 wrote that she rang the front door bell and Privacy Policy answered, telling them she did  not call the police. She told them to get off her property and \"slammed the door shut.\"4° Officer  wrote:  13.43  \"The screen door was locked. We continued to knock on the door but she refused to open it. Sgt  BARNETTE removed screen door as we continued to attempt to make contact with OT1. I can hear  OT1 telling us to get off her property. She was advised that we need to talk to her to make sure  she is ok. She said she was fine. OT1 eventually opened the door and again told Officers to get off  her property. She was taken into custody until the Ambulance arrived. OT1 was advised she  needed help (Crisis). She continued to tell Officers that we are harassing her.\" 41 Officer 13.43 reported that Privacy Policy appeared to very agitated and upset and she stated that  officers were \"kidnaping\" her from her home. She also complained that officers were holding her arms  too tightly, so they allowed her to sit while awaiting an ambulance. Officer 13.43 reported that  was placed on a hold at the direction of \"Squad 502\", which was Sgt. Barnette\\'s call sign on that  PPI  date.  PPI  There is no discussion in Officer 13.43  report of Privacy Policy possibly being mentally ill. In the only  discussion of Privacy Policy state of mind, Officer 13.43 wrote, \"OT1 appeared to be very agitated and  upset...Throughout the whole time, OT1 was very argumentative, agitated, and uncooperative.\" 42 There  is no information in this report stating that Privacy Policy was a danger to herself or any other person. The  comment placed in VisiNet by Emergency Communication Center personnel warns officers that  may fight with them; however, there is no statement in this report or any other reports that  offered any resistance to them or verbalized any threat.  PPI  PPI  Application By Peace or Health Officer For Emergency Admission:  PPI  PPI  Prior to Privac Polic transport to Fairview Southdale Hospital, Officer 13.43 filled out and signed the  Application By Peace or Health Officer For Emergency Admission form. The form requires the officer  completing the form to state under what circumstances and for what reasons the person on whom they  placed the hold was taken into custody. The following information was submitted by Officer 13.43  \"Female continuously called 911 and per dispatcher female was verbally agitated and not making  sense. Per Shift Sgt, Squad 502, a hold was place [sic] on the female.\" 43 There is no information in this statement to explain why the officers believed Privacy Policy was \"mentally  ill, mentally retarded or chemically dependent and in imminent danger of injuring self or others.\" It  simply states that a dispatcher found Privacy Policy \"verbally agitated\" when she called 9-1-1 so Sgt.  Barnette wanted a mental health hold placed on her.  Deposition of Officer  Officer 13.43  13.43  13.43  was deposed on 01/18/2018.44 In her deposition during direct examination, Officer  said that her partner (Officer 13.43) and she were dispatched to  check on her welfare since.

When Officer 13.43 returned to the front door, he apologized and they left.  Officer 13.43  13.43  was asked if Privacy Policy threatened them or anyone else with violence and Officer  stated, \"Not to my knowledge that she threatened anyone besides what our call remarks said.\" 46 Officer 13.43 was then asked if they followed up any information which was provided in the call and  she replied she did not call anyone. She also testified that she did not observe anything to indicate  was a danger to herself or to others and she had no information that Privacy Policy had any  mental illness.47 PPI  PPI  Officer 13.43 then was asked about the second call to Privac Polic residence. She said a second call  came to them on their squad computer screen to return to Privac Polic home. When asked what  information was provided to them regarding the call, she replied that all she could recall were \"pieces of  the remarks that she was calling 9-1-1 very agitated, several times.\" 48 Officer 13.43 was questioned about the purpose for returning to Privac Polic residence. She said  that, according to the remarks in the call, Sgt. Barnette had ordered that Privacy Policy was to be placed  on a \"hold\" and that she would be taken to the hospital regardless of whether she was willing to go.49 Officer 13.43 also testified that she had no knowledge about why she would be taken to the hospital  outside of the call remarks.5°  Officer 13.43 was questioned about her understanding of the reasons someone would be placed on a  hold. She replied:  \"A. Some of the reasons may be if they\\'re -- they want to harm themselves, they want to harm  others. They can\\'t take care of themselves or others. These are just some of the things.  \"Q. Any other reasons that you can recall?  \"A. I\\'m pretty sure there is. I just can\\'t think of all of it right at this second.\" 51 Then she was asked specifically about Privacy Policy  \"Q. What is your understanding of the reason that Privacy Policy was going to be taken to the  hospital?  \"A. Her call remarks, sir.  \"Q. Okay. In terms of the criteria for putting a hold on someone, do you know if any of these  criteria that you mentioned apply?  \"A. Well, per call remarks, whatever my sergeant said that\\'s what goes.  \"Q. You weren\\'t trying to determine for yourself what the reason was for holding  \"A. At that point, no.\" 52 Privacy Policy 7  Officer  13.43  was asked several questions regarding Minneapolis Police Department policy and  Minnesota statutes that give officers authority to place an individual on a mental health hold.  \"Q. So as you sit here, you are not able to describe what the statute says?  46 Ibid., Page 22, line 7-8  47 Ibid., Page 21, line 21 through Page 22, line 25  48 Ibid., Page 24, line 21  49 Ibid., Page 25, Line 23 and Page 26, line 15  5° Ibid., Page 26, Line 18  5\\' Ibid., Page 27, lines 5-8  52 Ibid., Page 28, line 18 to Page 29, line 6  Page 14 of 27  1332764 \"A.

I don\\'t remember the specifics of it.\" 53 After Officer  at  second  PPI  13.43  Privac Polic  was questioned about the sequence of events when they arrived for the second call  residence, she was asked what happened after Privacy Policy opened the front door the  time. Officer 13.43 stated that all three officers entered the residence. She testified that  had not given them permission to enter:  \"Q. So why did you enter the house without permission?  \"A. Well, per call remarks, we were to take her and put a hold on her.  \"Q. Okay. So, the purpose was to come into the house and then take her out to the hospital?  \"A. Yes.\" 54 PPI  Officer 13.43 was asked if she determined, after entering the home, if Privacy Policy needed help. She  said, no and it wasn\\'t her call. When asked who\\'s call it was, she said, \"My Sergeant.\"55 Officer  said she didn\\'t have or form an opinion about whether or not Privacy Policy needed help. When asked  13.43  about her observations of Privacy Policy  explain what she meant, Officer 13.43  Officer  stated:  13.43 stated she observed aggression. When asked to  \"Q.

She identified the officers who grabbed Privacy Policy as Officer  and Sgt. Barnette. When asked if she knew why they grabbed her, Officer 13.43 replied, \"No.\"58 Officer 13.43 was asked if she observed anything about  hold to be placed on  knowledge if  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy  Privacy Policy that she thought would justify a  Officer 13.43 replied, \"No.\"59 Officer  had any diagnosis of mental illness. 60  13.43 also said she had no  Officer 13.43 stated in her deposition that she never got any information about the caller to 9-1-1 who  claimed to be a cousin to Privacy Policy . He was never identified and the officers did not get any  clarification about what this person meant about Privacy Policy threatening him and his family beyond  what\\'s in the remarks. She also stated that the comment \"Unknown mental health Diagnosis\" indicates  that the caller doesn\\'t know if she is diagnosed with any mental illness.61 The Assistant City Attorney began his examination of Officer 13.43 following a thirteen (13) minute  break. He prefaced the questioning by saying that he wanted to \"broaden the questions a little bit beyond  just your direct observations, and ask some questions about reasonable beliefs based not just on those  observations.\" 62 He asked her to read the comments in the VisiNet reports for the two calls Officer  and Officer 13.43 were involved with. The first one was regarding the original 9-1-1 call from the  in which he alleged that Privacy Policy called him and  13.43  person claiming to be a cousin of  threatened him and his family.  The Assistant City Attorney asked her to read the comment that was entered by one of the officers at the  end of the call [Officer 13.43 could not recall who entered the comment] where Privacy Policy was  characterized as \"very aggressive and agitated and uncooperative.\" He did not, however, ask her to read  the comment that follows in which the officer who entered the information writes, \"she appeared to be  A-okay.\"  Privacy Policy  The Assistant City Attorney asked Officer 13.43 about the information related to the 9-1-1 calls made  by Privacy Policy between the first and second call Officer 13.43 responded to.

Privacy Policy might fight  The Assistant City Attorney asked Officer 13.43 if she had reviewed each of the comments relating to  the calls prior to arriving at Privac Polic  home. She said she did. He then asked, based on this  information and her experience as a police officer if it was reasonable to believe that Privacy Policy was  mentally ill and a threat to others. Officer 13.43 answered, \"Yes.\"63 Officer 13.43 was questioned again by Privac Polic attorney. The examination began with an inquiry  and subsequent argument between attorneys regarding a meeting that occurred between the Assistant  City Attorney and Officer 13.43 during the break which preceded the examination of Officer  by the Assistant City Attorney.64 Officer 13.43 was the asked if she had any prior knowledge of a mental illness diagnosis of  and she said, \"No.\" She was asked if she spoke to the person who alleged the threats and she said, \"No.\"  She was asked if she knows who that caller is and she said, \"No.\" She was also asked if she knows if that  person was, in fact, a cousin and she, again, said, \"No.\" Officer 13.43 was also asked if she or if anyone  in the Minneapolis Police Department knew the identity of the caller or of the nature of the alleged  threat and she said, \"No, I don\\'t.\"65 \"Q. Do you agree that you don\\'t know if they -- if the threats did occur, you don\\'t know if they  were threats of violence?  13.43  Privacy Policy  \"A. I do not know.  \"Q. Okay.

No, sir.\" 66 Sergeant Shannon Barnette:  Training  During her deposition, Sgt. Barnette was asked if she had any specific training on dealing with people  with mental illness during her career with the Minneapolis Police Department.67 She stated that the  \"majority of the department\" went through a 1-week crisis intervention training program \"approximately  a year ago.\"  Sgt. Barnette was then questioned about other specific training she attended during her career dealing  with people with mental illness. These classes were documented in her training records. One class was  63 Ibid., Page 69, line 11 to Page 75, line 24  64 Ibid., Page 76, line 2 through Page 78, line 7  65 Ibid., Page 78 line 9 through Page 82, line 18  66 Ibid., Page 87, line 21 through Page 88, line 17  67 United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Civil Case 17-2920, Deposition of Sergeant Shannon L.  Barnette dated 01/16/2018, beginning Page 19, line 19  Page 17 of 27  1332767 Trauma Training dated 07/10/2017. When asked if she could remember anything about that training, she  replied, \"No. Not specific.\"68 The next course was Taser training, CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) coach certification, on 12/5/2016. She  stated that, upon completion of the course, she was asked to coach Crisis Intervention; however, when  asked about the course, she stated, \"I don\\'t remember specifics.\"69 Sgt. Barnette discussed Crisis Intervention Team training, 05/09/2016 through 05/13/2016. When asked  if she recalled any specific details about the course dealing with people with mental illness, she, again,  could not recall specific details.7°  One last class mentioned by Sgt. Barnette from her training records was Early Intervention Training from  2010 and 2009. About this course, Sgt. Barnette stated, \"I specifically -- I don\\'t have specifics for you, but  part of it is recognizing people that are struggling mentally, either in crisis or that kind of stuff\" 71 Sgt. Barnette was asked how she can identify if someone has mental illness. She responded, \"I think there  is — I don\\'t know if you can specifically. I think it has to be on a case-by-case basis.\" She was next asked  what\\'s her definition of mental illness. Sgt. Barnette responded, \"Oh. I don\\'t have a specific -- I don\\'t  know if there is one specifically to give.\" 72 Sgt. Barnette was then asked, \"So is that something you do try to identify in your work as a police officer  if someone has a mental illness?\" Sgt. Barnette replied that she would try to identify if she thought  someone was in crisis. She was then asked for her definition of \"in crisis.\" Sgt. Barnette replied that it  could be varying from case to case. When asked for some examples, Sgt. Barnette replied\"  \"Well, there is the example of people that specifically call and say that they are in one. Like I said,  it would be -- it would have to be a specific event that I could give specifics on why I thought that  person was in a crisis.\" 73 Sgt. Barnette was then asked several questions about what she has been taught about responding to  people who are in crisis. Again, she replied that it was a \"case-by-base situation.\" She was next asked if  she had been given any definitions for what it means to be in a crisis. Sgt. Barnette replied, \"Well, I think  that there\\'s many definitions of that. I don\\'t think there is any specific.\"74 \"Q. What are the -- what are the definitions that you\\'re aware of?  \"A. Again, it would have to be something, a specific case.  \"Q. You don\\'t have any specific definitions?  \"A. No.\" 75 Sgt. Barnette was questioned about her knowledge of an officer\\'s authority to place someone on a  mental health hold. 76 She was asked if she had any specific training on placing someone on a mental  health hold. She replied that would have been part of the training on \"dealing with the mentally ill.\"77 When asked which of the training courses discussed previously during her deposition contained that  68 Ibid, Page 23, line 23  69 Ibid, Page 23, line 23 to Page 24, line 13  70 Ibid, Page 24, Line 20 through Page 25, line 4  71 Ibid, Page 25, line 7-9  72 Ibid, Page 25, Line 25 through Page 26, line 12  73 Ibid, Page 26, line 13 to 25  74 Ibid, Page 27, line 16-17  75 Ibid, Page 27, lines 18 through 23  76 Ibid, beginning Page 28, line 2  77 Ibid, Page 28, line 18  Page 18 of 27  1332768 information, she had no recollection.78 When Sgt. Barnette was asked to explain from where her  knowledge of her authority to place someone on a mental health hold came, she replied, \"I  / can\\'t  specifically answer that.\" 79 Sgt. Barnette was questioned about her knowledge of the Minnesota Statute that defines under what  circumstances a person can be placed on a mental health hold. When asked if she was aware of any  criteria given in the statute for when she could place someone on a mental health hold, she replied that  she would have to review the statute to answer the question.8° Sgt. Barnette was asked several questions  regarding the number of persons she placed or caused to be placed on mental health holds. She could  not recall the exact number, however, she recalled having Privacy Policy placed on a hold in this matter.  She was again asked if she recalled the specific statutory criteria for placing someone on a mental health  hold and she replied, \"1 would have to review it.\" 81 Mental Health Hold placed on Privacy Policy :  During her deposition, Sgt. Barnette stated that it was her decision to place Privacy Policy on a mental  health hold. When asked what were her reasons for this decision, Sgt. Barnette replied, \"Oh, there was  several reasons...I felt that she was in a mental health crisis because of her behavior.\"82 Sgt. Barnette was asked to explain all the reasons why Privacy Policy was placed on a hold. Sgt. Barnette  replied, \"Specifically, the information that she was repeatedly calling 911 about an officer not coming to  her home after calling 911 earlier in the day... And when I spoke to her on the phone she seemed quite  upset... She was very agitated. If I remember correctly, she wasn\\'t listening that I -- that an officer had  come out. Very upset.\" 83 Sgt. Barnette was asked if Privacy Policy made any threats of harm or violence  toward her (Sgt. Barnette), herself, or others during this phone call. Sgt. Barnette said she either didn\\'t  believe so or couldn\\'t recall.84 Sgt. Barnette was asked about the 9-1-1 calls placed by Privacy Policy that day. Sgt. Barnette could not say  how many calls were placed nor could she say what the calls were about or the tone of her voice. Sgt.  Barnette also said she did not listen to any of the recordings and did not speak with any of the call  takers.85 Sgt. Barnette discussed the first welfare check call to Privac Polic home by Officer 13.43 and Officer  ; however, Sgt. Barnette did not know many details of that call as she was not there. After  on the phone, she accompanied Officer 13.43 and Officer 13.43 back to  13.43  speaking with  home.  PPI  Privacy Policy  PPI  Sgt. Barnette was asked if there was any other factor(s) upon which she based her decision. Sgt. Barnette  discussed a phone call she had with Privacy Policy a year or more before in which Privacy Policy complained  about circumstances involving the death of her sister. Sgt. Barnette was asked what about that incident  was relevant to her decision to place her on a hold. Sgt. Barnette replied, \"1 just remember that I had  dealt with her on the phone a year or two prior and felt at that point that maybe there was some mental  issues with thinking that her sister was still alive when medical personnel were telling her that she had  passed.\" 86 She was asked if everyone that has mental health issues should be involuntarily hospitalized  and she said, \"No.\"  78 Ibid, Page 28, lines 22 through Page 29, line 1  79 Ibid, Page 29, line 15  80 Ibid, Page 31, linel8 to Page 32, line 18  81 Ibid, Page 34, line 12-15  82 Ibid, Page 35, line 24 to Page 36, line 6  83 Ibid, Page 38, line 6-18  84 Ibid, Page 47, line 14-24  85 Ibid, Page 44, line 4 to Page 45, line 3  86 Ibid, Page 50, line 23 to Page 51, line 5  Page 19 of 27  1332769 Sgt. Barnette was asked if she decided before going to Privacy Policy residence to place her on a hold and  she said, \"No.\" She was asked what was her plan and she said she wanted to talk to her to make sure she  wasn\\'t just angry. She was also asked if she instructed Officer 13.43 and Officer 13.43 to place  on a mental health hold prior to going to the residence. She replied she had not. When  reminded that she was under oath and asked if that was her testimony, she replied, \"Yes.\"87 PPI  PPI  The above testimony from Sgt. Barnette is contradicted by Officer 13.43 supplement report, Officer  13.43 \\' supplement report, and the timeline in the VisiNet Incident Detail Report (CCN #17-191393).  Sgt. Barnette was asked to explain what it was about  PPI  Privacy Policy behavior that caused her to place PPI  on a mental health hold. Sgt. Barnette stated:  \"A. When we got -- she was -- when we got out there she was extremely agitated. Like I said, her  -- she seemed very frazzled, was yelling at us. I had told her, you know, that -- she had made  some comment about someone being in her house. And I said, well, you know, we had just talked  on the phone and she had never said someone was in her house. I believe I said that they were on  a retaining wall. It was just -- she just seemed very upset and just seemed to be in a crisis to me.  I was worried for her.  \"Q. What do you mean by \"a crisis\"?  \"A. That she just -- she wasn\\'t listening to what we were saying. She wasn\\'t being reasonable. I  don\\'t think that when I -- we tried to talk to her about a cousin who had called to check the  welfare, she didn\\'t believe that that had happened. She was talking about Privacy Policy who was  a vulnerable adult. It was very all over the place.\" 88 Sgt. Barnette was asked if that conversation was before or after she decided to place Privacy Policy on a  hold. Sgt. Barnette replied, \"At the point that I decided to place her on a hold is when I removed the  screen door.\"89 There was additional inquiry on this topic:  \"Q. So your testimony was that at the time that you removed the screen door was when you  decided -- you made a final decision you were going to be placing Privacy Policy on a mental health  hold?  \"A. I made the decision to place her on a mental health hold and then removed the screen.  \"Q. Okay. All right. So, that was, obviously, before you entered her house?  \"A. Correct.  \"Q. And up until that time had you had any conversation with her about Privacy Policy  You know,  up until that -- during your visit with her at the house had you had any -- what did you talk -- let  me do it this way.  \"What had you spoken to her about while you were at the house before you removed the screen?  \"A. I just -- I told you what we talked about.  \"Q. Okay. So, your testimony was that you had that conversation before you removed the  screen?  87 Ibid, Page 51, line 25 to Page 52, line 16  88 United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Civil Case 17-2920, Deposition of Sergeant Shannon L.

Dozens of other lawsuits have made similar claims. IN 2013, AMY Krekelberg received an unsettling notice from Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources: An employee had abused his access to a government driver’s license database and snooped on thousands of people in the state, mostly women. Krekelberg learned that she was one of them. MARLIN LEVISON/STAR TRIBUNE/GETTY IMAGES 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 2/5 When Krekelberg asked for an audit of accesses to her DMV records, as allowed by Minnesota state law, she learned that her information—which would include things like her address, weight, height, and driver’s license pictures—had been viewed nearly 1,000 times since 2003, even though she was never under investigation by law enforcement. In fact, Krekelberg was law enforcement: She joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2012, after spending eight years working elsewhere for the city, mostly as an officer for the Park & Recreation Board. She later learned that over 500 of those lookups were conducted by dozens of other cops. Even more eerie, many officers had searched for her in the middle of the night. Krekelberg eventually sued the city of Minneapolis, as well as two individual officers, for violating the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, which governs the disclosure of personal information collected by state motor-vehicle departments. Earlier this week, her case prevailed. On Wednesday, a jury awarded Krekelberg $585,000, including $300,000 in punitive damages from the two defendants, who looked up Krekelberg’s information after she allegedly rejected their romantic advances, according to court documents. “I think that the jury’s verdict shows that people do take privacy quite seriously and that they take women’s privacy seriously,” says Sarah St. Vincent, a surveillance and national security researcher at Human Rights Watch who attended the trial. She is studying similar cases across the country. Louise Matsakis covers Amazon, internet law, and online culture for WIRED. There have been dozens of lawsuits against Minneapolis and other Minnesota cities in recent years over alleged abuses of license databases. Most of the cases were settled out of court or dismissed; Krekelberg’s is the only one to have gone to trial. Two of Krekelberg’s lawyers, Sonia Miller-Van Oort and Jonathan Strauss, say that their client suffered harassment from her colleagues for years as the case proceeded, and that in at least one instance, other cops refused to provide Krekelberg with backup support. She now works a desk job. “We are disappointed in this verdict, but the city takes very seriously the importance of data privacy,” says Susan L. Segal, the Minneapolis city attorney. She stressed that the police department’s policies have changed in recent years. Minneapolis employees are now required 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 3/5 to enter a reason when they search DMV records. Previously, to learn to use the database, officers were encouraged to “go back to work and look up some of [their] friends and family members,” says Segal. “There was not this awareness.” Minnesota did have at least one rare accountability measure in place: It kept a log of when the DMV database was searched, and citizens have the right to request their file. Without that digital trail, Krekelberg likely wouldn’t have had the evidence to bring a case. In many other states, similar protections don’t exist, even for more advanced technologies, like facial recognition software. Policies can differ greatly between police departments, says Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “There’s virtually no uniformity,” she says. That makes it difficult for citizens to know when their information has been improperly accessed by the government, which happens not infrequently. A 2016 investigation by the Associated Press found hundreds of instances where law enforcement officials misused confidential databases for personal purposes, like to dig up dirt on romantic partners, neighbors, and journalists. One Ohio officer ran checks on his ex-girlfriend, and pleaded guilty to stalking her. Two Miami-Dade officers looked up a reporter who published negative stories about their department. “I was a trooper for a long time and it was a common practice for troopers to run someone’s name through the [Massachusetts criminal record] system for reasons besides law enforcement,” Michael Szymanski, a former state trooper who was disciplined for abusing a police database, told CommonWealth Magazine in May. “I can’t tell you how many times I saw troopers run their next-door neighbor through [the system], run their old girlfriends’ names, or run someone who they’re having a dispute with.” The problem goes beyond DMV and criminal records databases. Law enforcement officials have also been caught abusing technology that allows them to monitor the location of people’s cell phones. In April, a former Missouri sheriff was sentenced to six months in prison for tracking a judge and members of the State Highway Patrol. Employees at private tech companies have also abused their access to databases of sensitive user information. Uber settled a lawsuit with the New York attorney general in 2016 over its 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 4/5 “God View” tool, which allowed employees to track the location of riders without their consent, including that of a Buzzfeed reporter. Employees at Snapchat also may have misused an internal tool to spy on users, according to a recent Motherboard investigation. More lawmakers have started advocating for data privacy regulations at the state and federal level, but those conversations have mostly focused on reining in big tech companies, rather than information that public employees can access. “It’s very hard for people to get any kind of redress for privacy violations,” St. Vincent says.

He's been retired.  By STEVE BRANDT Star Tribune  JULY 19, 2011 — 12:29AM Sometimes cops get the wrong suspect. Sometimes police dogs bite the wrong man. That's why the city of Minneapolis is planning to pay $25,000 to one of its own, officer Bruce Johnson, and his attorney after one of its canine enforcers bit him on the hands and arms last Oct. 29. The attack on Johnson was one of at least two by Benny the police K-9, who has gone into retirement after costing the city $105,000 in legal settlements. \"The dog just got the wrong person,\" said Johnson's attorney, Robert Bennett. Bennett also represents Abel Miamen, who won an $80,000 settlement from the City Council on July 1 following an attack by Benny. \"The dog has had several incidents,\" Bennett said. According to a report to the council, Johnson, a 39-year veteran of the force, was working in uniform off-duty and using a marked squad car when he heard a call involving a police pursuit on the Broadway Avenue bridge. He arrived as the fleeing vehicle stopped, and officer John Bennett was pulling the suspect out of his vehicle to the ground. Benny ran past Bennett and the suspect and repeatedly bit Johnson. Johnson missed several weeks of work because of injuries and might need surgery, his attorney said. Benny is a 74-pound German Shepherd dog imported from Eastern Europe. He joined the department in 2003 for both patrol and narcotics duties. Bennett started with the department in 1990, and has been with the canine unit since 2003. The police department is reviewing the incident for potential discipline. The $25,000 award is over and above the worker compensation costs paid by the city for lost wages and medical expenses, Bennett said. He argued to the city that the matter constituted a civil rights violation because it represented excessive force. \"The dog shouldn't have been deployed the way it was deployed,\" he said. A City Council committee Monday approved the settlement urged by city lawyers, setting it up for full council approval on Friday. Steve Brandt • 612-673-4438 . Benny the police K-9 worked on Minneapolis patrol and narcotics squads, but several biting incidents have cost the city. The dog is now\n",

      "3/18/2021 Minneapolis ofﬁcer ordered back on the job after ﬁring for punching handcuffed man | MPR News https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/12/02/minneapolis-ofﬁcer-ordered-back-on-the-job-after-ﬁring-for-punching-handcuffed-man 1/2 Crime, Law and Justice Minneapolis o¨cer ordered back on the job after ¦ring for punching handcuffed man Brandt Williams Minneapolis December 2, 2019 10:08 p.m. Minneapolis police in October 2015. Courtesy of Minneapolis Police Department 2015 A Minneapolis police officer who was fired after he punched a handcuffed man in his face several times has been given his job back. Officer Peter Brazeau was fired earlier this year for using excessive force. But an arbitrator, citing mitigating factors, reduced Brazeau’s termination to an 80-hour suspension without pay. In December 2016, officers Brazeau and Alexander Brown struggled with a man in downtown Minneapolis. According to the arbitrator’s report, the officers were trying to put the unnamed man in “protective custody” and take him to the hospital. Brazeau told his supervisor that the man was intoxicated and trying to “start fights with people.” At first, the man was cooperative, said Brazeau. But the man became combative once he was in cuffs. The report says Brazeau told supervisors that as the man was cuffed and on his back, he kicked Brazeau in the chest, knocking the wind out of the officer and the body-worn camera off his uniform. “Then, I placed my knee on his chest and delivered three to four strikes to his face,” said Brazeau. Officer Brown also struck the man in his face while the two tried to get him under control, reads the report. The report says medical responders administered ketamine, a powerful sedative, to calm the man down. The use of the drug by medical responders on people in police custody would later spark controversy. In a 2018 study, the city’s police conduct review office found eight instances in which officers gave an opinion or asked EMS employees to inject ketamine into people. The man was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and a broken nose, but he left before being discharged. The report says doctors were not able to determine “or suggest” how the man received the injuries. Brazeau had reported that the man had blood on his face and hands before he and his partner took the man into custody. According to the report, Chief Medaria Arradondo sacked Brazeau telling him in a departmental communication, “your actions were unwarranted and unacceptable.” Labor arbitrator Sherwood Malamud found the termination to be excessive punishment for an officer given multiple departmental awards. Malamud added that Brazeau’s work in the First Precinct “at a job performance level of exceeds expectations, serves as mitigating factors which make the imposition of the discharge penalty inappropriate.” State law allows Brazeau to challenge a termination through a “veteran’s preference” process. He received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps after twice being deployed to serve in Iraq. He joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2013. Malamud also directed the Minneapolis police department to retrain Brazeau on a few different aspects of handcuffing, including “how to address continued resistance by a handcuffed individual due to their level of intoxication or mental impairment.” Police spokesperson John Elder said Brazeau is not yet back on the job. 3/18/2021 Minneapolis ofﬁcer ordered back on the job after ﬁring for punching handcuffed man | MPR News https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/12/02/minneapolis-ofﬁcer-ordered-back-on-the-job-after-ﬁring-for-punching-handcuffed-man 2/2 Your support matters.

Adrian Police Chief Shawn Langseth tells KSFY News 43-year-old Richard David Bruns is on administrative leave indeﬁnitely, effective immediately. According to court documents, the incident happened Friday night at the couple's home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The victim told authorities she had three beers and Bruns had eight. She said Bruns was allegedly \"snippy\" with her and their two children when they arrived home, and an argument started. Bruns was \"raging mad\" when he got into the house and asked his wife and 12-year-old son to ﬁght him. The son \"smarted off\" to Bruns and ran outside. Bruns followed, and his wife said she then heard a loud noise outside on the porch. Then she heard he son crying. When she ran to her son, Bruns allegedly began pushing her away with his stomach or chest. The couple's daughter then came into the room, and the victim told her to run across the street to her grandmother's house and call 911. After the children left, Bruns and his wife got into another argument about calling the police. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, according to court documents. Bruns then allegedly used keys to unlock a gun safe. His wife could be heard yelling at him to put the gun down and get it away from her on the recordning. He allegedly told her, \"Cops come knocking on my door, you’re dead,\" and that if he was going to go to jail, he was going to \"earn it.\" She pleaded with him and said she did not want to die. Bruns was then heard on the recording locking the gun safe. According to court documents, Bruns admitted to police that he and his wife had been having issues for a long time and said he had gone to far during the incident. He told police he did not think he pointed a gun at his wife. Authorities seized multiple ﬁrearms from the home, including handguns, a riﬂe and a shotgun. They also found a lock-box style gun safe with two handguns and two loaded magazines inside of it. The 12-year-old son told police that Bruns never touched him. Authorities arrested Bruns on second degree assault with a dangerous weapon, intent to terrorize and two counts of domestic assault (a misdemeanor). He was released from Nobles County Jail after posting a $100,000 bond with several conditions, including no contact with the victims. The Compass Center for victims of domestic violence in Sioux Falls says members of law enforcement are not immune from abusive relationships. \"When the perpetrator is someone in law enforcement it makes it much more difﬁcult for a survivor to tell their story,\" The Compass Center Director Michelle Markgraf said. \"The person that they report to is often the friend of the perpetrator and it is sometimes difﬁcult for them to tell their friends that this is going on.\" Markgraf said if someone is afraid to report abuse directly to law enforcement, the Compass Center can help. Give them a call at (605) 339-0116 if you are experiencing abuse or fear for the safety of you or your family.

ADAM UREN · SEP 9, 2019 The fatal, of}cer-involved shooting of Brian Quinones in Rich}eld Saturday night has subsequently led to protests and complaints of excessive use of police force. The 30-year-old died after he was subject of a police chase between Edina and Rich}eld, which he live-streamed in his car. Twelve minutes into the video, Quinones got out with what appears to be a knife in his left hand. Moments later shots are heard, with police }ring about 12 times. In a statement on Sunday, Edina and Rich}eld Police Department said Quinones \"confronted of}cers with a knife\" at 77th Street East and Chicago Avenue in Rich}eld. His death sparked protests at the scene and a march on Sunday night, that brie~y led to the shutting down of I-494 in Rich}eld. Quinones worked the night-shift at General Mills, per his Facebook page, but was an aspiring hip- hop artist known as Blessed The MC, citing in~uences including Kanye, DMX, Kid Cudi, Nas and Eminem, among many others. Posts he made on his Facebook page in the days before his death provided a foreshadowing of what would occur. One of his }nal Facebook posts stated: \"So sorry,\" and he also uploaded his entire album, \"T.I.M.E.: This Is My Everything.\" This album featured lyrics that some of his friends suggest referred to what was going to happen, including the line: \"Get ready, cuz it’s gonna hurt, right?\" and \"They killed him. This ain’t the way it’s supposed to go. They killed him, and I’m just supposed to be here.\" A married father of a 12-year-old boy, Quinones was a barber as well as a musician, his brother, Joshua Quinones, told KSTP.  His brother also told the TV station that Quinones had been having suicidal thoughts, and he had grown concerned having spoken to him just before the chase and shooting, and tried to reach out to him when he saw his Facebook stream. 3/6/2021 What we know about Brian Quinones, the man shot dead by police in Richfield - Bring Me The News https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/what-we-know-about-brian-quinones-the-man-shot-dead-by-police-in-richfield 2/2 Friends described him to the Star Tribune as a loving family man, though one noted he had struggled in the recent years with \"}nances, his living situation and relationships.\" Quinones lived in Rich}eld, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Of}ce. His Facebook page states he was originally from Ponce, Puerto Rico, though he has lived in Minnesota for a long time and attended high school in the Twin Cities. The City of Edina said that the investigation into his shooting will be conducted by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Of}ce, with more information expected to be released in the coming days. \"The City of Edina grieves alongside the family of the deceased, the of}cers involved and their families, and the Rich}eld and Edina communities,\" its statement said. KARE 11's Lou Raguse notes that Quinones' family is being represented by attorney Robert Bennett, who recently secured a $20 million settlement from the City of Minneapolis over the shooting of Justine Damond.

      "Minneapolis Police Officers:  350 S. 5th St.   Minneapolis, MN 55415    Dear Everyone - but especially Minneapolis citizens,     An Open Letter to express what the vast majority of Minneapolis Police Officers feel at this moment.        We wholeheartedly condemn Derek Chauvin. We Are With You in the denouncement of Derek  Chauvin’s actions on Memorial Day, 2020. Like us, Derek Chauvin took an oath to hold the sanctity  of life most precious. Derek Chauvin failed as a human and stripped George Floyd of his dignity and  life.  This is not who we are.     We Are With You and want to communicate a sentiment that is broad within our ranks. We ask that  our voices be heard. We are leaders, formal and informal, and from all ranks within the Minneapolis  Police Department. We’re not the union or the administration. We are officers who represent the  voices of hundreds of other Minneapolis Police Officers. Hundreds. We acknowledge that Chief  Arradondo needs each of us to dutifully follow him while he shows us the way. We stand ready to  listen and embrace the calls for change, reform and rebuilding.        We Are With You moving forward.  We want to work with you and for you to regain your trust.      Sincerely,    Minneapolis Police Officers:  Mark Klukow     Charlie Adams     Darcy Klund      Christie Nelson    Nick Torborg     Mike Kirchen     Pete Stanton      Gary Nelson      Rich Jackson     Mohamed Abdullahi    Molly Fischer     Steve McCarty  John Delmonico    Richard Zimmerman         The above letter represents our statement in whole.

Dozens of other lawsuits have made similar claims. IN 2013, AMY Krekelberg received an unsettling notice from Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources: An employee had abused his access to a government driver’s license database and snooped on thousands of people in the state, mostly women. Krekelberg learned that she was one of them. MARLIN LEVISON/STAR TRIBUNE/GETTY IMAGES 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 2/5 When Krekelberg asked for an audit of accesses to her DMV records, as allowed by Minnesota state law, she learned that her information—which would include things like her address, weight, height, and driver’s license pictures—had been viewed nearly 1,000 times since 2003, even though she was never under investigation by law enforcement. In fact, Krekelberg was law enforcement: She joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2012, after spending eight years working elsewhere for the city, mostly as an officer for the Park & Recreation Board. She later learned that over 500 of those lookups were conducted by dozens of other cops. Even more eerie, many officers had searched for her in the middle of the night. Krekelberg eventually sued the city of Minneapolis, as well as two individual officers, for violating the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, which governs the disclosure of personal information collected by state motor-vehicle departments. Earlier this week, her case prevailed. On Wednesday, a jury awarded Krekelberg $585,000, including $300,000 in punitive damages from the two defendants, who looked up Krekelberg’s information after she allegedly rejected their romantic advances, according to court documents. “I think that the jury’s verdict shows that people do take privacy quite seriously and that they take women’s privacy seriously,” says Sarah St. Vincent, a surveillance and national security researcher at Human Rights Watch who attended the trial. She is studying similar cases across the country. Louise Matsakis covers Amazon, internet law, and online culture for WIRED. There have been dozens of lawsuits against Minneapolis and other Minnesota cities in recent years over alleged abuses of license databases. Most of the cases were settled out of court or dismissed; Krekelberg’s is the only one to have gone to trial. Two of Krekelberg’s lawyers, Sonia Miller-Van Oort and Jonathan Strauss, say that their client suffered harassment from her colleagues for years as the case proceeded, and that in at least one instance, other cops refused to provide Krekelberg with backup support. She now works a desk job. “We are disappointed in this verdict, but the city takes very seriously the importance of data privacy,” says Susan L. Segal, the Minneapolis city attorney. She stressed that the police department’s policies have changed in recent years. Minneapolis employees are now required 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 3/5 to enter a reason when they search DMV records. Previously, to learn to use the database, officers were encouraged to “go back to work and look up some of [their] friends and family members,” says Segal. “There was not this awareness.” Minnesota did have at least one rare accountability measure in place: It kept a log of when the DMV database was searched, and citizens have the right to request their file. Without that digital trail, Krekelberg likely wouldn’t have had the evidence to bring a case. In many other states, similar protections don’t exist, even for more advanced technologies, like facial recognition software. Policies can differ greatly between police departments, says Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “There’s virtually no uniformity,” she says. That makes it difficult for citizens to know when their information has been improperly accessed by the government, which happens not infrequently. A 2016 investigation by the Associated Press found hundreds of instances where law enforcement officials misused confidential databases for personal purposes, like to dig up dirt on romantic partners, neighbors, and journalists. One Ohio officer ran checks on his ex-girlfriend, and pleaded guilty to stalking her. Two Miami-Dade officers looked up a reporter who published negative stories about their department. “I was a trooper for a long time and it was a common practice for troopers to run someone’s name through the [Massachusetts criminal record] system for reasons besides law enforcement,” Michael Szymanski, a former state trooper who was disciplined for abusing a police database, told CommonWealth Magazine in May. “I can’t tell you how many times I saw troopers run their next-door neighbor through [the system], run their old girlfriends’ names, or run someone who they’re having a dispute with.” The problem goes beyond DMV and criminal records databases. Law enforcement officials have also been caught abusing technology that allows them to monitor the location of people’s cell phones. In April, a former Missouri sheriff was sentenced to six months in prison for tracking a judge and members of the State Highway Patrol. Employees at private tech companies have also abused their access to databases of sensitive user information. Uber settled a lawsuit with the New York attorney general in 2016 over its 4/11/2021 Cop Gets $585K After Colleagues Snooped on Her DMV Data | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/minnesota-police-dmv-database-abuse/ 4/5 “God View” tool, which allowed employees to track the location of riders without their consent, including that of a Buzzfeed reporter. Employees at Snapchat also may have misused an internal tool to spy on users, according to a recent Motherboard investigation. More lawmakers have started advocating for data privacy regulations at the state and federal level, but those conversations have mostly focused on reining in big tech companies, rather than information that public employees can access. “It’s very hard for people to get any kind of redress for privacy violations,” St. Vincent says.

      "2/25/2021 Minneapolis cop under investigation by federal authorities - StarTribune.com https://www.startribune.com/a-minneapolis-cop-is-under-investigation-by-federal-authorities/303953561/ 1/2 MINNEAPOLIS A Minneapolis police officer is under investigation by federal authorities Michael Griﬃn has been the subject of 22 internal aﬀairs investigations since 2007.  By Randy Furst (https://www.startribune.com/randy-furst/6370613/) and Matt McKinney (https://www.startribune.com/matt-mckinney/6370539/) Star Tribune staﬀ writers MAY 16, 2015 — 11:49AM Federal authorities are investigating a Minneapolis police officer who has been the target of two brutality lawsuits that have cost the city $410,000. The investigation focuses on Michael Griffin, a patrol officer in north Minneapolis, who joined the police force in 2007. Griffin has been the subject of 22 police internal affairs investigations, a total that may include both public complaints and internal department issues. Most of the claims against him were not upheld. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. However, a number of sources told the Star Tribune that the FBI has been making inquiries that include questions about two excessive force lawsuits in which Griffin was accused of punching or kicking people while he was off-duty at downtown bars. The sources spoke on condition that they would not be identified. A number of Minneapolis police officers reportedly have been questioned by the FBI and told to be prepared to give testimony to a federal grand jury. “I am troubled that any grand jury process would be reported on by the media,” said Ryan Kaess, a St. Paul attorney, who said “at this point,” he is Griffin’s lawyer. Kaess described Griffin as “a fine police officer,” but declined further comment. John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, said that due to the federal investigation, his office was not allowed to discuss it. Look at 22 investigations According to documents provided Friday by the Minneapolis Police Department, 16 of the 22 internal affairs investigations of Griffin resulted in no discipline, while one led to a letter of reprimand over the issue of “use of reasonable judgment.” Elder said he could offer no details of the reprimand. Five other cases — two from 2013, one from 2014, and two from 2015 — remain open. The possible prosecution of Minneapolis police officers occurs at a time in which police have been under the microscope across the nation over allegations of misconduct, including alleged brutality and the shooting deaths of several black people. Griffin is black. Complaints against him have come from both white people and people of color. Prosecutions in Minnesota for police misconduct are highly unusual. The Justice Department prosecuted Minneapolis police officer Jason Andersen, a member of the now-defunct Metro Gang Strike Force, over the kicking of a black youth in Crystal. He was found not guilty in 2010. Current U.S. Attorney Andy Luger, then a private attorney, was appointed to investigate the Metro Gang Strike Force and issued a report in 2009 that criticized the conduct of several officers, including their treatment of minorities. JEFF WHEELER Michael Griffin 2/25/2021 Minneapolis cop under investigation by federal authorities - StarTribune.com https://www.startribune.com/a-minneapolis-cop-is-under-investigation-by-federal-authorities/303953561/ 2/2 The Justice Department reviewed the allegations but took no action beyond Andersen’s prosecution. The Hennepin County attorney’s office declined to prosecute. Hennepin County attorney Mike Freeman said at the time that he was hampered because Strike Force officers declined to talk to investigators. ‘He lost perspective’ Griffin won a departmental medal of valor for his response to the 2012 multiple shootings at Accent Signage. “When Michael Griffin first came on to the department there were high expectations of him,” says Ron Edwards, a longtime civil rights activist, who is a member of a police oversight group appointed by Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau. “But at some point down the road he lost perspective,” Edwards said. “The department has really tried to work with him and tried to work through his problems, but it’s quite clear that some of the incidents have caught the attention of federal investigators and now his fate is in their hands. I still think that he would make a good police officer with a productive career, but he needs help with his problems.” In January 2014, a jury awarded $125,000 to Jeremy Axel, an IT salesman from St. Louis Park, in his suit claiming that Griffin challenged him to a fight in a Minneapolis bar in 2011, then knocked him out, leaving him with a concussion. In March 2014, U.S. District Judge David Doty ordered the city to pay Axel’s attorney $145,653. A month later, the City Council approved a $140,000 settlement with Ibrahim Regai, who alleged that he was threatened, followed, then punched and knocked to the ground by Griffin outside a Minneapolis bar in 2010.

      "3/2/2021 MPR: Feds won't prosecute Minneapolis officers in plunger case news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/06/04_williamsb_porter/?refid=0 1/2 AUDIO Feds won't prosecute Minneapolis officers in plunger case (story audio) PHOTOS Officer Jeff Jindra YOUR VOICE Join the conversation with other MPR listeners in the News Forum. E-mail this page Print this page Feds won't prosecute Minneapolis officers in plunger case by Brandt Williams, Minnesota Public Radio June 4, 2004  Officer Jeff Jindra, speaking for the first time since the allegations surfaced, said it was a relief to be cleared after eight months with the allegation hanging over his head. (MPR Photo/Brandt Williams) The U.S. Justice Department has determined that no federal criminal charges should be filed against two Minneapolis police officers accused of sexually assaulting a suspect last October. Officers Todd Babekuhl and Jeff Jindra were accused of sodomizing Stephen Porter with a toilet plunger handle during a drug raid at a north Minneapolis home. Minneapolis police say the determination means the case is closed. But some community activists say the case isn't necessarily done yet.  Minneapolis, Minn. — Some of the city's top elected officials and law enforcement officers attended the release of the results of the FBI investigation. Mayor R.T. Rybak called it one of the happiest press conferences he'd ever attended. Police Chief William McManus says the federal government's determination affirms his own department's internal investigation into the matter. McManus says the accused officers have been cleared and have been returned to full duty. \"These officers and their families have paid a huge price as a result of these outrageous and false accusations,\" McManus said. \"The reputation of every Minneapolis officer was affected by these charges. Today I stand behind officers Babekuhl and Jindra as I'll do for any officer falsely accused of misconduct.\" It took nearly eight months for the results of the FBI investigation to become public. For much of that time, officers Babekuhl and Jindra were at home on paid leave. Then, last winter, then-police Chief Robert Olson returned them to desk duty. Because the officers were under investigation, they couldn't go public with their side of the story. \"I chose to be a Minneapolis cop, but my kids didn't,\" Jindra said. \"To explain that to them on the first day was really a tough thing. They're much stronger than I gave them credit for. And the people they go to school with were very nice. They got together and had a prayer meeting for me. You want to scream and yell from the rooftops about your innocence, but you just can't.\" Jindra says he still can't reveal too much about the events which were the basis for Porter's allegations. But he did say Porter was given a body cavity search. In a prior incident, Porter was arrested on drug charges after officers discovered crack cocaine hidden in his buttocks. Porter claimed the two officers assaulted him. He made charges at a time when a series of federally mediated negotiations took place between community members and the police. Racial profiling and police brutality and similar issues were on the table. Despite their anger over the Porter allegations, community activists were determined to continue their talks with the police department. \"This is perhaps one of the tests for the new PCRC because we're not, today, seeing eye to eye in principal on this matter,\" said Rev. Ian Bethel, the co- chair of the Police Community Relations Council, made up of community leaders and police officialscharged with implementing the agreement formed late last year. Bethel says he and other activists don't think the FBI findings necessarily mean the case is closed. Porter's lawyer is state Rep. Keith Ellison, DFL- Minneapolis, who was pursuing a possible civil case. Ellison did not return calls from MPR for comment. But several months ago, Ellison told MPR that he was conducting his own investigation. He also said the outcome of the FBI's investigation wouldn't affect the case. Bill English, the chair of the African American Leadership Summit, says the determination made by the Justice Department doesn't rule out all wrongdoing. \"The operative word here is 'prosecutable offense.' That's an operative word. That's a clear indication that it wasn't a necessarily a blanket clearance. There was no prosecutable offenses. We can live with that,\" English said. English and Rev. Bethel agree with police officials that the length of the FBI's investigation did a disservice to the officers, the department and the community. Bethel acknowleged that the long wait meant the officers had to live under a cloud of suspicion for eight months. English agreed that the long wait also fostered more mistrust from the community toward the police. English, Bethel and other activists have expressed support for Chief McManus' decision to handle officer misconduct investigations in-house. They say such investigations could be done quickly. And they say they trust McManus' ability to make sure the investigations are fair. Stephen Porter was not present at the announcement. He is serving a three year drug possession sentence in St. Cloud.

This memo summarizes  my approach and reasoning for my decision as Chief of the Minneapolis Police Department that     against Officer Joseph Klimmek   sustained.  This memo accompanies the enclosed  suspension form.  Facts Supporting Decision (see also Investigation Summary):  It is alleged that Officer Klimmek failed to use caution and due consideration for the safety of the public  during emergency vehicle operation; he was involved in a crash after entering an intersection against  the red light and colliding with the vehicle that had the right of way.  He was not using the squad’s siren,  the emergency lights were operating on Code 2 status with front and back flashers and he was not  wearing a seatbelt.  According to the Accident Review Committee Summary, on 1/28/2020 Officer  Klimmek was driving MPD marked SUV squad 110 eastbound on 12th Street North, responding to assist  a MN State Patrol trooper stopping a stolen vehicle at 12th Street/3rd Avenue South.  Officer Klimmek  was driving with emergency lights on CODE 2 status (back and front emergency lights in alternating  flashing mode) and he did not have the siren activated. As Officer Klimmek approached Hennepin  Avenue, he had a red light. A minivan travelling northbound on Hennepin Avenue had a green light to  enter the intersection.  The minivan struck the squad on the passenger side door in a t-bone collision.  The minivan driver stated she did not hear a siren, saw only blue light flashing on squad, and did not  have time to react as she entered intersection. The driver of the minivan reported that she had back and  neck pain.     Both vehicles had airbags deployed and had to be towed from scene.       EDR also  provided speed and braking information for the incident:  as Officer Klimmek approach the intersection  with Hennepin, he slowed to 9mph before accelerating.  5 seconds before the impact, the squad car was  traveling at 30.6 mph. The accelerator pedal indicated 0, meaning the accelerator pedal was not being  depressed, so the vehicle was coasting at that speed. At the 1.5 seconds before impact mark, the  accelerator was depressed to 100% (floored) up to the point of impact, where speed was reduced to  22.1 mph, and accelerator was at 98%. The brakes were activated up to 2 seconds before crash, and  were then released, and not applied again until post-crash.  In his Garrity statement, Officer Klimmek said that he slowed down “for safety purposes to make sure no  one was coming.” Officer Klimmek continued, “I believe I looked both directions, um, and I didn’t see  anyone coming, uh, which is why I proceeded through the intersection.”  He thought he had activated  his emergency lights all the way rather than only to second position.  At the time of the accident he was  “just about” to activate the siren.       The following MPD Policy and Procedures outline expectations relevant to this incident:  \u0010\u001b\u0015\u001d\u0014\u0018\u0017\u001a \u0011\u001a\u001e\u0016\u0019\u001b\u001c\u0016 \u0013\u0010 \u0011 \u000f\u000f\u0007\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0012\u0005\u0011\f\u0002\u0007\u0012\u000b \u0002\u000e\u0003\u0004\f\u0002 \u000e\u0011\u0003 \u0006\u000f\u0003\u0007\u000f x        x  MPD PP 7-401(D)(4) requires that ordinarily officers use continuous lights and siren during  emergency driving unless the incident necessitates an unannounced approach.  x          As Chief of Police I am responsible for providing clear expectations on what is acceptable behavior in our  workplaces as well as what will not be tolerated. Based on my review of the facts of this investigation,  Officer Joseph Klimmek failed to use both lights and siren continuously while engaging in emergency  driving.  He entered the intersection at 12th Street and Hennepin Avenue South against the red light with  no siren to warn drivers approaching the intersection.  I noted that the EDR confirmed Officer Klimmek’s  statement that he slowed before he accelerated into the intersection.  I believe this indicates that  Officer Klimmek did intend to take measures to protect the safety of the public during his emergency  driving; however, in failing to engage the siren at the commencement of emergency driving and use it  continuously, he missed a necessary step to warn others on the roadway of the need for caution [PP 7- 401 (D)(4)].  A crash resulted from his driving conduct.    the driver of the other  vehicle reported suffering pain as a result of this crash and could have suffered much greater harm.   Therefore, as Chief of Police with authority to discipline for violations of policy under Minn. Stat.  §626.89 Subd. 17, I am imposing a 20-hour suspension.

ADAM UREN · SEP 9, 2019 The fatal, of}cer-involved shooting of Brian Quinones in Rich}eld Saturday night has subsequently led to protests and complaints of excessive use of police force. The 30-year-old died after he was subject of a police chase between Edina and Rich}eld, which he live-streamed in his car. Twelve minutes into the video, Quinones got out with what appears to be a knife in his left hand. Moments later shots are heard, with police }ring about 12 times. In a statement on Sunday, Edina and Rich}eld Police Department said Quinones \"confronted of}cers with a knife\" at 77th Street East and Chicago Avenue in Rich}eld. His death sparked protests at the scene and a march on Sunday night, that brie~y led to the shutting down of I-494 in Rich}eld. Quinones worked the night-shift at General Mills, per his Facebook page, but was an aspiring hip- hop artist known as Blessed The MC, citing in~uences including Kanye, DMX, Kid Cudi, Nas and Eminem, among many others. Posts he made on his Facebook page in the days before his death provided a foreshadowing of what would occur. One of his }nal Facebook posts stated: \"So sorry,\" and he also uploaded his entire album, \"T.I.M.E.: This Is My Everything.\" This album featured lyrics that some of his friends suggest referred to what was going to happen, including the line: \"Get ready, cuz it’s gonna hurt, right?\" and \"They killed him. This ain’t the way it’s supposed to go. They killed him, and I’m just supposed to be here.\" A married father of a 12-year-old boy, Quinones was a barber as well as a musician, his brother, Joshua Quinones, told KSTP.  His brother also told the TV station that Quinones had been having suicidal thoughts, and he had grown concerned having spoken to him just before the chase and shooting, and tried to reach out to him when he saw his Facebook stream. 3/6/2021 What we know about Brian Quinones, the man shot dead by police in Richfield - Bring Me The News https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/what-we-know-about-brian-quinones-the-man-shot-dead-by-police-in-richfield 2/2 Friends described him to the Star Tribune as a loving family man, though one noted he had struggled in the recent years with \"}nances, his living situation and relationships.\" Quinones lived in Rich}eld, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Of}ce. His Facebook page states he was originally from Ponce, Puerto Rico, though he has lived in Minnesota for a long time and attended high school in the Twin Cities. The City of Edina said that the investigation into his shooting will be conducted by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Of}ce, with more information expected to be released in the coming days. \"The City of Edina grieves alongside the family of the deceased, the of}cers involved and their families, and the Rich}eld and Edina communities,\" its statement said. KARE 11's Lou Raguse notes that Quinones' family is being represented by attorney Robert Bennett, who recently secured a $20 million settlement from the City of Minneapolis over the shooting of Justine Damond.

Driver and  other passenger in vehicle then fled in vehicle and a pursuit was initiated. Vehicle eventually stopped due to vehicle disability at  Highway 394 and Penn Avenue. Driver and other passenger arrested on scene.  CUAPB000055 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 3 of 24  002-ORIGINAL REPORT 224 02/11/2014  REPORT NARRATIVE:  On 2/11/14 at approximately 0206 hours, I, Officer D. Zielin, Badge #224 while on routine patrol in a  fully marked squad car, was westbound 85th Avenue at the intersection of Edinbrook Parkway when I  observed a Toyota Camry bearing Minnesota plate VNL670 turn from northbound Thomas Avenue North  onto westbound 85th Avenue North at a high rate of speed. The vehicle took a wide turn as it turned  westbound onto 85th Avenue North and then continued westbound in the southern-most lane of  westbound travel. I caught up to the vehicle along the 3300 block of 85th Avenue North still traveling  westbound and ran the plate VNL670 in my squad computer. While I was waiting for my computer to  return the license plate information, the vehicle signaled a turn and entered the turn lane to turn left  into the Central Container Manufacturing business. I slowed down to make sure I had the correct plate  and as the vehicle turned, I continued westbound waiting for the results. As I passed the vehicle, the  vehicle was returned as a 1992 Toyota Camry. As I was scrolling through the registered owner  information, my computer alerted me at that time. I scrolled down the page and could see that the  vehicle was returned as an unconfirmed stolen out of Minneapolis.  I then turned my squad around and proceeded back eastbound toward Central Container, knowing that  the only entry and exit to the Central Container parking lot is on 85th Avenue North. As I continued  eastbound, the same Toyota Camry pulled back out from the Central Container parking lot and  continued eastbound in the southernmost lane of eastbound travel.  I then alerted dispatch that I was currently behind that vehicle eastbound at Edinbrook Crossing.  Speeds at this point were 40 miles an hour and I could see that the vehicle was occupied three times.  I then continued to follow the vehicle eastbound while other officers responded to my location. I then  followed that vehicle eastbound onto 85th to Logan Avenue North where the vehicle turned right to go  southbound on Logan Avenue. Once southbound on Logan Avenue, the vehicle then turned left and  went westbound on 84th Avenue North. The vehicle then turned right and went southbound on James  Avenue North and then took a left and went southbound on Irving Avenue North. Speeds at this time  were approximately 20 miles per hours southbound on Irving.  I was alerted by other officers that they were coming into the area and officers were placed in the area  of 80th and Irving as well as 80th and Humboldt. As I continued southbound behind the vehicle and  approached 80th Avenue North, I could see two squads parked at the intersection. The vehicle then  turned eastbound onto 80th Avenue North toward Humboldt Avenue North. As I had other squads with  me at that time, I then initiated a traffic stop at the intersection of 80th Avenue North and Irving Avenue  North.  After activating my emergency lights, the vehicle failed to stop and proceeded slowly forward to  Humboldt Avenue North where it took a left to go north on Humboldt. I was advised by other officers  that they were behind me and I asked the driver of the second car behind me, Officer Courtright, if he  was pit certified. Officer Courtright indicated that he was pit certified and I coordinated with him to  move ahead of me to become the lead vehicle in case the vehicle fled and that I would be second  vehicle and call the pursuit.  The vehicle then proceeded northbound on Humboldt up to Highway 252 where it took a right to go  southbound on 252. While the vehicle was still going slow, it had not attempted at any point to stop  and I initiated a pursuit at that time at the intersection of Highway 252 and Humboldt Avenue North.  CUAPB000056 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 4 of 24  The vehicle then moved over into the disabled lane to the right side and across the fog line of  southbound 252. The vehicle then appeared to come to a stop along the side of the road southbound  252. I saw Officer Courtright open his door and start to get out of his vehicle. I then stopped my vehicle  and jumped out and ran up to the lead middle vehicle, which was Officer Angerhofer's vehicle on the  passenger side. At that point and time, I had my gun out and could hear Officer Angerhofer giving  commands to the occupants of the vehicle to stop and put their hands up. I also observed there was an  open door on the passenger side of the vehicle and at that time realized that one of the occupants had  fled and that Officer Courtright and Officer Miller were in pursuit of that suspect.  The driver and passenger of the vehicle failed to comply with officer commands and the vehicle quickly  sped southbound on 252 re-entering the southbound lanes of travel. I then ran back to my squad, got in  and started to pursue the vehicle. Officer Angerhofer was the lead vehicle and Officer B. Yang was the  second vehicle. I was third vehicle in the pursuit as there were two occupants of the vehicle.  The vehicle then fled southbound on Highway 252 and Officer Angerhofer asked if any of the Brooklyn  Park squads that were in the pursuit were pit certified. I was not pit certified and I heard Officer Yang  also advise that he was not pit certified. A Brooklyn Center squad, who was approximately a half mile  behind me in the pursuit with lights and sirens on advised that she was pit certified. However, shortly  thereafter, that Brooklyn Center squad discontinued their portion of the pursuit. The vehicle then fled  eastbound on Highway 94 and I continued as third car.  Speeds eastbound on Highway 94 approached 100 miles per hour. The Toyota then exited on 53rd  Avenue North, continued straight through the intersection at the top of the ramp and then got back  onto eastbound 94 at 49th Avenue.  The vehicle then continued eastbound on 94 and made a quick exit onto Dowling and then continued  south onto 4th Street. The vehicle then continued southbound on 4th Street south of 31st Avenue and  then turned westbound onto an unknown street. The vehicle continued westbound to Fremont Avenue  where it then turned southbound.  The vehicle continued southbound on Fremont to 12th Avenue where it turned left and went  eastbound.  As I was traveling southbound on Fremont Avenue North, I was approximately an eighth of a mile  behind the second vehicle in this pursuit. I could see the squads in front of me and could see that they  made a left-hand turn.  The intersection based on my observations of the squads turning appeared to be a lazy turn to the left.  As I got up to the intersection traveling approximately 50 to 60 miles per hours, I realized that the  intersection was a 90-degree turn to the left and attempted to slow down. I was unable to fully stop at  that time and the front of my squad struck a snow bank just south of the intersection of Fremont and  12th Avenue. My squad, #1596 was not damaged when it hit the snow bank, but the front tires were  caught in the snow and my rear tires, which were still in the street were unable to pull me out.  I then notified dispatch that I was out of the pursuit and asked dispatch for a tow truck to pull me out. I  then got out of my squad to see how deep I was in the snow when a security guard driving a large truck  came by and advised that he worked at the business next door. The individual asked if I wanted him to  CUAPB000057 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 5 of 24  pull me out of the snow bank with a tow cable that he had. I accepted the individual's offer and he was  able to pull me out of the snow bank back onto the street without damage.  I then notified Sergeant Banks that I was out of the snow bank and I was advised by Sergeant Banks to  return to Brooklyn Park, which I did.  I was advised that the individual who fled on foot at the intersection of Humboldt and Highway 252 had  been apprehended and was identified as Charles Jeffrey Peterson, dob: 12/27/88. I was advised by  Officer Courtright and Miller, who did catch him that the individual had methamphetamine on his  person.  I was then later advised that Minneapolis Police Department had assisted in the pursuit of the stolen  vehicle and the vehicle was stopped due to internal damage within the vehicle from the pursuit. I was  advised that the vehicle came to a stop due to the mechanical disability at the intersection of Highway  394 and Penn Avenue. I was also advised that both the driver, identified as James Douglas Mitchell,  dob: 1/12/91 and the passenger identified as Robert Allen Lilienfeld, dob: 6/11/59 had been  apprehended. I was also advised that the vehicle was on fire.  Please reference Minneapolis case number 14-044893 for more information regarding Minneapolis  Police Department assistance in this pursuit and apprehension.  Peterson, Lilienfeld and Mitchell were transported by other officers to the Brooklyn Park Police  Department and booked. Mitchell and Lilienfeld were charged for Felony Possession of Stolen Vehicle  as well as Felony Fleeing.  Peterson, who had fled on foot was charged with Felony Possession of a Stolen Vehicle, Felony Drugs as  methamphetamine was found on his person, and Flee on Foot.  At the time of this report, all three individuals are still in custody at the Brooklyn Park Police Department  jail.  I filled out a State Pursuit form and that was turned into my supervisor.  That vehicle was confirmed as a stolen vehicle out of Minneapolis entered on 2/10/14 from an address  18 U.S.C. 2521 DMV Data  No further action taken at this time.  DICTATED BY: Officer D. Zielin, Badge #224, Squad #1596  CUAPB000058 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 6 of 24  CUAPB000059 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 7 of 24  003-SUPPLEMENT 232 02/11/14  SUPPLEMENT: CASE #14-006457  On 02/11/2014 at 02:07 hours, Officer D. Zielin, Badge #224 with the Brooklyn Park Police Department,  was on 85th Avenue in the area of Edinbrook Crossing North when he located a 1992 Toyota Camry  bearing Minnesota license plate VNL670. It was confirmed stolen out of Minneapolis.  Officer Zielin notified officers of his location and that the vehicle was stolen. At this time I caught up to  Officer Zielin in the area of Humboldt and 80th Avenue, where Officer Zielin activated his emergency  lights along with several Brooklyn Park officers. The vehicle continued driving northbound on Humboldt  Avenue.  At this time Officer Zielin asked if I could move into Vehicle #1 position in the pursuit due to me being  PIT certified. At this time I got in front of Officer Zielin, directly behind the suspect vehicle, and had my  siren activated.  The vehicle continued northbound on Humboldt, approaching Highway 252. At this time the vehicle  turned southbound on Highway 252 and was driving very slowly. I could see the three occupants in the  vehicle moving around, causing the vehicle to shake. The windows were partially fogged up to where I  could not tell what the passengers were grabbing for inside the vehicle. After the vehicle drove  approximately a block and a half, it came to a stop where the back seat passenger exited the back  passenger door and started to flee on foot.  At this time I began pursuing the individual on foot, giving him commands to stop. Officer J. Miller,  Badge #230, assisted me in pursuing the passenger. After the male had jumped a large fence on the  west side of the road, I deployed my Taser X2, striking the suspect in the jacket. During the five second  cycle of the deployment, it caused partial lock-up on the suspect. Due to the suspect's thick jacket, the  Taser probes did not penetrate his person and he was able to run and break the Taser wires. Officer J.  Miller jumped the fence and continued to pursue the suspect on foot to where he was able to deploy his  Taser X2, stopping the suspect.  After jumping the fence, I assisted Officer J. Miller in taking the subject into custody. The male was  identified by his Minnesota driver's license as Charles Jeffrey Peterson, date of birth: 12/27/1988.  Peterson's hands were secured behind his back in handcuffs. I checked the handcuffs for tightness and  double locked them.  I conducted a search incident to arrest on Peterson. At this time I removed two Taser probes from  Peterson's back. The Taser probes were inspected and were fully intact. The Taser probes were later  destroyed at the Brooklyn Park Police Department.  A pack of Newports was removed from Peterson's right pocket on his jacket that he was wearing at the  time and Officer J. Miller took custody of Peterson's property. Officer J. Miller later located a baggie of a  crystal substance that was NARTEC tested at the Brooklyn Park Police Department and tested positive  for methamphetamine.  Officer J. Miller took custody of Peterson at this time and transported him to the Brooklyn Park Police  Department where he was booked for Probable Cause Narcotics, Motor Vehicle Theft, Flee Police in  Motor Vehicle, and Flee Police on Foot. See Officer J. Miller's narrative report for further details.  CUAPB000060 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 8 of 24  DICTATED BY: Officer N. Courtright, Badge #232, Squad 1590  CUAPB000061 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 9 of 24  004-SUPPLEMENT 210 02/11/14  SUPPLEMENT: CASE #14-006457  On 02/11/2014 at approximately 02:21 hours, I, Officer J. Angerhofer, Badge #210, was on routine patrol  when I heard on the radio that Officer Zielin was behind a vehicle that had come back stolen out of  Minneapolis. Officer Zielin stated at this time that he was eastbound on 85th Avenue. At this time I  began to head towards Officer Zielin by travelling north to Brookdale Drive and then east on Brookdale  Drive. At this time Officer Zielin continued to update his location.  As I was travelling east on Brookdale Drive, Officer Zielin stated that he was turning south onto Logan.  As Officer Zielin continued to update his location, I determined that my best route was to get to  Humboldt Avenue and 80th Avenue as he would be coming out that way from the direction he was  travelling. Once I arrived at 80th and Humboldt, Officer Zielin stated that he was on the 8100 block of  Irving, at which time I turned west on 80th, waiting for him at 80th and Irving.  At this time I observed the suspect vehicle along with Officer Zielin behind it traveling south on Irving  Avenue, turning east onto 80th Avenue. At this time I made a U-turn, getting behind Officer Zielin and  Officer Courtright, who were already behind the vehicle.  Officers all initiated their emergency lights and sirens at 80th and Humboldt. The vehicle at this time  continued to travel at a slow rate of speed, but did not come to a stop. The vehicle travelled north on  Humboldt Avenue to 252, at which time it turned south on 252.  After turning south on 252, the vehicle began to drive on the shoulder at a slow rate of speed. At this  time I swung my squad car out into the lane of traffic to ensure the lanes of traffic were stopped during  the high-risk stop. The vehicle, a short time later, did come to a stop and a passenger exited the vehicle.  At this time the vehicle began to roll a little distance forward and at this time I positioned my squad car  closer to the vehicle as the officers directly behind the car had gotten out, running after the passenger  who had fled on foot.  At this time I got out of my vehicle, drawing my service weapon. I gave verbal commands for the driver  to show his hands. These verbal commands were not being followed. A short time later the vehicle sped  off.  At this time I began to pursue the vehicle south on 252. I radioed the direction the vehicle was going  until Officer Yang took over calling out the pursuit.  The vehicle travelled south on 252 turning onto eastbound 94. The vehicle travelled eastbound on 94,  exiting on the 51st Avenue exit. The vehicle immediately got back onto 94 at the 49th Avenue entrance,  then continuing to travel eastbound on 94.  The vehicle was travelling eastbound on 94, exiting on Dowling Avenue. The vehicle exited on Dowling  Avenue and continued to travel south on 4th Street. The vehicle travelled south on 4th Street and then  turned west on an unknown street, but it is believed the street was in the 20's. The vehicle travelled  west on this street until Fremont Avenue, where it turned south on Fremont Avenue. The vehicle  continued south on Fremont Avenue until it came to a \"T\" intersection and then turned east on 12th  Avenue. The vehicle then merged south onto 7th Street. The vehicle followed 7th Street until merging  south onto 10th Street. The vehicle then turned westbound on Glenwood. The vehicle then turned  CUAPB000062 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 10 of 24  south on Royalston/12th Street. The vehicle continued south on 12th Street, at which time I lost the  vehicle at 12th Street and Lasalle.  While I was pursuing the vehicle, it did turn off its headlights on 4th Street, just prior to turning off of  4th Street. The vehicle also was not stopping at any stop signs or traffic control devices. At a majority of  the stop signs and traffic control devices, the vehicle did not even slow down prior to entering the  intersection.  After losing the vehicle, a short time later Minneapolis Police Department was monitoring the chase on  LTAC and did pick up the vehicle. Minneapolis began to pursue the vehicle, at which time it turned onto  Highway 394 and started on fire. At this time I began to head towards Minneapolis' location.  Upon arrival to Minneapolis' location, I made contact with Sergeant Banks who stated that I needed to  transport one of the individuals up to our Police Department. I transported the individual who was later  identified as James Mitchell to the Brooklyn Park Police Department.  Mitchell was in the back of a Minneapolis car at this time. I had Mitchell step out. I placed my handcuffs  on Mitchell, checking them for tightness and double locking them. I had at this time taken off the  handcuffs that were on him. Mitchell was then patted down and placed in the back seat of my squad  car. At this time Mitchell was brought to the Brooklyn Park Police Department. Other officers booked  Mitchell in to the Brooklyn Park Police Department.  DICTATED BY: Officer J. Angerhofer, Badge #210, Squad 1606  CUAPB000063 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 11 of 24  005-SUPPLEMENT 230 02/11/14  SUPPLEMENT: CASE #14-006457  On 02/11/2014 at approximately 02:07 hours, I, Officer J. Miller, Badge #230, along with other officers  of the Brooklyn Park Police Department went to help Officer Zielin who had located a confirmed stolen  vehicle out of the City of Minneapolis. I was able to catch up to Officer Zielin in the area of 80th Avenue  and Humboldt Avenue North. I was the fourth car in the pursuit and I was given information by Officer  Zielin that the vehicle was occupied at least three times.  The initial part of the pursuit was very slow and continued for approximately three or four blocks, at  which point the vehicle was going south on 252, just south of Humboldt. I did observe, as we attempted  a felony stop, a white male get out of the rear of the vehicle and begin running away from the vehicle.  Officer Courtright began a foot pursuit and, at that point in time, the vehicle then sped off at a high rate  of speed.  I informed other officers that I was going to continue in the foot pursuit with Officer Courtright. As I  approached the shoulder on the west side of 252, I could see Officer Courtright was at a fence and the  suspect had apparently made it over the fence. As I came up to the fence, I observed the suspect over  the fence and Officer Courtright had deployed his Taser.  At that point in time, I jumped over the fence. As I was jumping over the fence, the suspect, who was  later identified as Peterson, was able to break free of the Taser deployment and again begin running. As  I approached Peterson in the area of Girard Avenue and Girard Court, I ordered him to stop. He still  refused to stop. As I gained on him, he began reaching into his coat and I could not see his right hand  anymore. At that point in time I deployed my Taser the first time and I did not get a good connection.  Peterson continued to move away from me so I again immediately deployed my second cartridge of my  Taser, at which point it was effective and Peterson went to the ground. I was able to command Peterson  to put his arms out to his sides and I waited for Officer Courtright to help me with assisting in taking  Peterson into custody.  Officer Courtright did a search incident to arrest and turned Peterson's belongings over to me. I then  transported Peterson to the Brooklyn Park Police Department jail and placed him into a cell. I did inform  Peterson that he was under arrest for at least fleeing on foot, and I would have to review the other  charges and also go through his property.  Peterson told me there was nothing in his property but, as I went through his property, I did find a  Newport cigarette pack. As I opened the Newport cigarette pack, I saw a clear plastic bag which  contained a white crystal-like substance. I did pull the crystal-like bag out and test it and it tested  positive for methamphetamine. The total weight of the methamphetamine inside the bag that I found  inside of the Newport cigarette pack was one point six (1.6) grams of NARTEC-tested  methamphetamine.  The booking of Peterson was later completed with the added charge for the probable cause narcotics.  After I tested the Methamphetamine I did property inventory the Newport cigarettes that I found the  bag of Methamphetamine in. I also inventoried the 1.6 grams of Methamphetamine along with the  plastic bag that contained the methamphetamine. These items were property inventoried under tag  numbers 107365 to 107367.

Yang, #229, was advised by Officer D. Zielin, #224, through radio on channel  two that he had a stolen vehicle that he was following behind. He gave his location therefore I made my  way over there.  At Humboldt Ave N and Hwy 252 I caught up to other Brooklyn Park officers. I observed the stolen  vehicle, which was a Toyota Camry, come to a complete stop. I observed one suspect jump out of the  vehicle during this time and other officers pursued him on foot.  I then got out of my car and drew my gun as we conducted a high-risk stop. The vehicle then drove off  once again.  I got in my vehicle and pursued the vehicle. I was the second police squad in the chase. I was driving  fully-marked squad 1608.  During this time the pursuit went southbound on Hwy 252 towards Hwy 94.  Officer J. Angerhofer, #210, was the first squad behind the suspect vehicle. See his report for the exact  route of the vehicle pursuit.  During the pursuit, I called out our location by radio.  As we continued through the pursuit we were going towards downtown Minneapolis. We got to the  intersection of Glenwood Ave and 10th Ave. Officer J. Angerhofer, #210, and the suspect made a quick  right turn. Therefore I was unable to make the turn with them. During this time I chose to terminate  myself from the pursuit because I was no longer able to see Officer Angerhofer's squad and the suspect  vehicle.  I continued through the possible area where they could've been through at a low rate of speed in an  attempt to look for them.  I was later advised by radio that Officer Angerhofer also had lost sight of the stolen vehicle.  Minneapolis then got on and stated that the vehicle had been located and they were in pursuit of the  vehicle. A short time later the vehicle stopped because the vehicle was on fire and they had two  suspects in custody. The location was eastbound on 1-394 and Penn Ave.  I made my way there. As I arrived I made contact with Minneapolis officers. They informed me that  there were two occupants in the stolen vehicle.  I observed that the front of the vehicle was totally engulfed in fire.  I was then walked over to a Minneapolis squad where the arrested party was sitting. I learned that he  was in the passenger seat of the stolen vehicle. He verbally identified himself as Robert Allen Lilienfeld,  06/11/59. It was confirmed through the Department of Vehicle Services (DVS).  CUAPB000066 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 14 of 24  I then placed handcuffs on him, checked for tightness and double-locked them.  I removed him from the Minneapolis squad and placed him in the backseat of my squad, 1608.  I then transported Lilienfeld to the Brooklyn Park jail.  I conducted the medical questionnaire. During the transportation to the Brooklyn Park jail, he  complained about his left elbow being possibly broken and his injury to his mouth. He also had pain in  his back. He stated that he knew he was in Minneapolis and he was beaten by the police, which was  Minneapolis.  All the injuries were written down on the medical questionnaire as he was being searched and placed in  the jail. Sgt. K. Banks, #100, was informed of his injuries.  I was also given his personal property from the stolen vehicle from the Minneapolis Police Department.  All the items were taken into my possession and later inventoried into the Brooklyn Park property room.  He had one black Nike one-strap backpack with miscellaneous stuff inside of it. I removed all the items  and nothing illegal was inside of it. It appeared that everything in the bag did belong to Lilienfeld. He  had numerous items with his name on them, such as mail.  The following items were inventoried into the property room:  - one aluminum walking cane inventoried under barcode number 107360  - one black Nike backpack with miscellaneous property inside of it was inventoried under barcode  number 107361  - one brown bag with miscellaneous clothing found inside of the Nike bag was inventoried under  barcode 107363  See other officers' reports for further information.

ORI: MN0270300.  007-SUPPLEMENT 100 02/11/14  Page: 15 of 24  SUPPLEMENT  14-006457  PRELIMINARY INFORMATION:  On 02/11/14 at 0207 hours the Brooklyn Park Police Department was involved in a motor-vehicle pursuit  involving a Minneapolis stolen vehicle that started in Brooklyn Park and ended in the city of Minneapolis  with three people total arrested for several offenses.  OFFICER'S OBSERVATIONS/ACTIONS:  On 02/11/14 at 0207 hours I, Sgt. K. Banks, #100, assigned to squad 1602, was on duty and monitored a  pursuit event initiated by a Brooklyn Park police officer, Officer D. Zielin, #224. He had aired that he  had ruil 18 U.S.C. 2521 DMV Data on a Toyota Camry that had come back as a stolen vehicle out of  Minneapolis.  I heard Officer Zielin on the main radio-dispatch channel asking for additional cars as he was following  this vehicle eastbound on 85th Ave N towards Hwy 252.  Officer Zielin stated the vehicle was driving south from 85th Ave N onto Logan Ave N into the  neighborhoods and he was going to continue to follow the vehicle until he could get additional officers  to respond to help him.  The vehicle continued driving with Officer Zielin following, which eventually led to Hwy 252 where a  felony traffic stop was about to be conducted as additional officers were now in position to assist Officer  Zielin.  Officer Zielin stated the vehicle was not stopping initially and was driving ten miles per hour southbound  on Hwy 252 as he was airing this over the Hennepin County main radio channel.  I heard that the vehicle ended up stopping moments later on the shoulder and then a male passenger,  later identified as Charles Peterson, fled from the vehicle at that time while the vehicle remained  stopped on Hwy 252.  I learned that Officer Zielin, along with a couple more officers, stayed with the stolen Toyota Camry and  began to give verbal commands to the driver, James Mitchell, and passenger, Robert Lilienfeld.  Officer Zielin informed officers that the vehicle then took off from the felony stop and Officer J.  Angerhofer, #210, and Officer B. Yang, #229, became the primary and secondary squads in pursuit of  this vehicle that was now traveling south on Hwy 252 approaching 1-694.  I asked how many occupants were in the vehicle at some point. I was told that there were three  however it was now down to two after the one person had run from the vehicle.  I monitored the radio as Officer Angerhofer had provided current speeds, location and traffic conditions.  I started driving towards the area of where the pursuit was going, which eventually led into Minneapolis.  CUAPB000068 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.  Page: 16 of 24  I overheard Officer Angerhofer state that the vehicle had exited the freeway at some point onto Dowling  Ave and then onto 4th St N, driving southbound in the neighborhoods.  Officer Angerhofer provided additional locations and speeds through the neighborhoods of north  Minneapolis and I also advised dispatch to contact the Minneapolis Police Department. They had  already been notified and were standing by and did respond and assist in this pursuit.  Officer Angerhofer continued following the vehicle and I heard him say the vehicle had entered around  Currie Ave or some street down near downtown Minneapolis as it was still eluding him.  Officer Angerhofer eventually aired that he had lost visual sight and contact with the vehicle at which  time I told him and other officers to terminate pursuit.  Moments later, Minneapolis police had located the vehicle somewhere near Penn Ave and  approximately Cedar Ave or Glenwood Ave and began pursuing the vehicle again onto eastbound 1-394.  The vehicle per Minneapolis police eventually stopped on 1-394 just east of Penn Ave N on its own and  began to catch fire.  Minneapolis police took into custody the driver, James Mitchell, and the passenger, Robert Lilienfeld,  and later handed them over to us, the Brooklyn Park Police Department.  Minneapolis police handled the custody tow and impounded the stolen vehicle at their impounded- vehicle facility in Minneapolis.  It should be noted that Officer Zielin did attempt to catch up with the pursuit in Minneapolis but had to  terminate the pursuit because he got stuck in a snow bank in a neighborhood in north Minneapolis so he  was told to return to the city of Brooklyn Park.  I responded to the final stop location on 1-394 and Penn Ave N area where Officer Yang was with  Minneapolis. I did request Officer Angerhofer to respond to assist in transporting James Mitchell and  Robert Lilienfeld.  When Officer Yang took custody of Robert Lilienfeld, he was complaining that he was injured by the  Minneapolis police officers who took him into custody and injured his left arm.  I did observe some blood on the upper lip just below the nose of Robert Lilienfeld.  While Lilienfeld was being transported to the Brooklyn Park Police Department, he did restate that he  was injured by the officers that pulled him out of the car on 1-394. I asked Lilienfeld if he knew what city  he was in and he stated, \"Yes, Minneapolis.\"  I asked Lilienfeld if he knew that the police officers that had pulled him out of the car were from the  Minneapolis Police Department and he stated yes he did.  Lilienfeld was eventually placed into a detention cell and he did request medical attention. This  information was forwarded to Sgt. S. Palmquist, #74, who was the upcoming dayshift supervisor, to  attend to whatever possible injury that Lilienfeld was complaining about.  CUAPB000069 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.

At no time during the booking process did Officers ask Peterson  about any of the crimes in question.  Peterson asked multiple times what he was being held on.  Officers informed Peterson of the listed charges.  During that time Peterson was confused about the  charge of fleeing in a motor vehicle and said a random utterance of \"but I was only in the vehicle for like  ten minutes.\"  No further statements were made from Peterson during the booking process.  No further action taken by this officer.  Stahnke #238, Squad 1596.  CUAPB000071 Case Number: 2014-00006457. ORI: MN0270300.

Initially after I apprehended him, after he was fleeing on foot, when  I put him in my squad car I asked him his name and said he would rather not say anything else. I did  reach into his wallet and right in the front case of the wallet behind the clear plastic is where I found the  identification, identifying him as Peterson. The height and weight were similar though the facial features  did not match exactly. After he was fingerprinted inside of our jail it was found his true identity and also  that he had an outstanding felony warrant out of another county. At this point in time, this is  information being as my 48 and all other items pertaining to it before I left during my shift when he was  apprehended referred to him as Peterson.

The City Council agreed to pay James and Aisha Keten $225,000 on March 29, a few weeks af- ter U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank wrote that he would not dismiss several counts of a complaint led in 2011. Most notably, Frank wrote that a reasonable juror could conclude that a Minneapolis police ocer acted unreasonably when he red multiple shots into small kitchen with a young girl nearby. According to court documents: Ocers on April 13 were conducting a search warrant, looking for an assault rie they believed was used by James Keten’s brother Lamont to shoot a woman eight days earlier. Ocers were warned that four potentially aggressive pit bulls were in the home, and also that children would be present. First, one ocer shot a 60-pound pit bill mix named Kano. The ocer testied that the dog charged him. Keten alleges that ocers hand-tied him and beat him, but a hospital could nd no bruises or injuries to Keten. Another ocer, Chad Fuchs, went into the kitchen where the couple’s 3-year-old daughter was eating breakfast.

ADAM UREN · SEP 9, 2019 The fatal, of}cer-involved shooting of Brian Quinones in Rich}eld Saturday night has subsequently led to protests and complaints of excessive use of police force. The 30-year-old died after he was subject of a police chase between Edina and Rich}eld, which he live-streamed in his car. Twelve minutes into the video, Quinones got out with what appears to be a knife in his left hand. Moments later shots are heard, with police }ring about 12 times. In a statement on Sunday, Edina and Rich}eld Police Department said Quinones \"confronted of}cers with a knife\" at 77th Street East and Chicago Avenue in Rich}eld. His death sparked protests at the scene and a march on Sunday night, that brie~y led to the shutting down of I-494 in Rich}eld. Quinones worked the night-shift at General Mills, per his Facebook page, but was an aspiring hip- hop artist known as Blessed The MC, citing in~uences including Kanye, DMX, Kid Cudi, Nas and Eminem, among many others. Posts he made on his Facebook page in the days before his death provided a foreshadowing of what would occur. One of his }nal Facebook posts stated: \"So sorry,\" and he also uploaded his entire album, \"T.I.M.E.: This Is My Everything.\" This album featured lyrics that some of his friends suggest referred to what was going to happen, including the line: \"Get ready, cuz it’s gonna hurt, right?\" and \"They killed him. This ain’t the way it’s supposed to go. They killed him, and I’m just supposed to be here.\" A married father of a 12-year-old boy, Quinones was a barber as well as a musician, his brother, Joshua Quinones, told KSTP.  His brother also told the TV station that Quinones had been having suicidal thoughts, and he had grown concerned having spoken to him just before the chase and shooting, and tried to reach out to him when he saw his Facebook stream. 3/6/2021 What we know about Brian Quinones, the man shot dead by police in Richfield - Bring Me The News https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/what-we-know-about-brian-quinones-the-man-shot-dead-by-police-in-richfield 2/2 Friends described him to the Star Tribune as a loving family man, though one noted he had struggled in the recent years with \"}nances, his living situation and relationships.\" Quinones lived in Rich}eld, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Of}ce.

The City of Edina said that the investigation into his shooting will be conducted by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Of}ce, with more information expected to be released in the coming days. \"The City of Edina grieves alongside the family of the deceased, the of}cers involved and their families, and the Rich}eld and Edina communities,\" its statement said.

This post was updated at 2¨10 p.m. on Jan. 20 to include additional information provided by the Robbinsdale Police Department and its chief. Melvin Newbern ‘glad he can put this behind him,’ says attorney After nearly two years, a resolution has been reached in Melvin Newbern’s lawsuit against Robbinsdale Police Sergeant Brian Sloat. Attorneys for both men reached an out-of-court settlement agreement Jan. 9 that will send $185,000 to Newbern, a Robbinsdale resident. After he was arrested Feb. 13, 2013, on charges of DWI and obstructing the legal process, Newbern xled a lawsuit alleging that Sloat used excessive force during the arrest. During the incident, then-Ofxcer Sloat used two “knee strikes” to bring the handcuffed Newbern to the ground after he refused to enter Sloat’s squad car. Newbern was later diagnosed with a concussion after reporting blurred vision and other concussion-like symptoms. 4/8/2021 UPDATED: $185,000 settlement in Robbinsdale excessive force suit | Public Safety | hometownsource.com https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_post/news/publicsafety/updated-185-000-settlement-in-robbinsdale-excessive-force-suit/article_6f15c68b-0062… 2/4 “For Melvin, he views it as a positive,” said Andy Noel, Newbern’s attorney, of the settlement. “He views it as an excellent result, and he’s basically glad he can put this behind him and just move forward.” Sloat attorney Jason Hively released a statement Jan. 12, which reads, “After a comprehensive analysis, we believe Ofxcer Sloat acted in a reasonable manner, but we recognize the cost of defending this case through trial would be very high.” Noel added that the settlement includes a clause asserting that neither party admits to any wrongdoing. The suit, which was xled in March 2013, sought $600,000 in damages. Other lawsuits Noel has leveled against law enforcements agencies have settled for $315,000, $325,000 and $15 million, according to his law xrm’s website. Noel also reached a $140,000 settlement with the City of Minneapolis in a separate excessive force case stemming from a May 29, 2010, incident between an off-duty Minneapolis police ofxcer and a bar patron. The settlement money will be paid by the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust, Hively added in his statement. Sloat continues to serve with the department. Noel had said previously that he does not intend for Sloat to be xred. City Manager Marcia Glick said the city is not considering launching its own investigation into the incident. When reached for comment, Robbinsdale Police Chief Jim Franzen said he had been instructed to refer inquiries to legal counsel. Franzen added that the department is not considering disciplining the sergeant. 4/8/2021 UPDATED: $185,000 settlement in Robbinsdale excessive force suit | Public Safety | hometownsource.com https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_post/news/publicsafety/updated-185-000-settlement-in-robbinsdale-excessive-force-suit/article_6f15c68b-0062… 3/4 The incident Newbern was driving home from a doctor’s appointment when, according to Sloat’s police report, he swerved along Victory Memorial Parkway several times, prompting Sloat to initiate a trafxc stop. Video of the incident was provided to the Sun Post by Robbinsdale police. In the video, Newbern’s car does not appear to swerve. However, the video does not show Newbern’s car’s path prior to entering the camera’s xeld of vision. Sloat instructed Newbern to perform multiple xeld sobriety tests. Newbern, according to the police report, had trouble maintaining his balance on one foot. Eventually, Sloat instructed Newbern to sit in the back seat of Sloat’s police car. Newbern, according to the report, made multiple attempts to stay seated there, but ultimately refused, insisting that he was “too big in size” and “claustrophobic.” Newbern, a former University of Minnesota basketball player, is 6-5 and weighs 330 pounds. Both the report and Noel say that Newbern asked for Sloat to “get the paddy wagon,” a larger police vehicle that may have more easily accommodated Newbern’s size. After a succession of refusals, Sloat informed Newbern that he was under arrest for obstruction of the legal process, handcuffed him and, again, instructed him to enter the squad car. When Newbern refused, Sloat used knee strikes to knock Newbern to the ground. Sloat called for backup, and Ofxcer Chris Woodhall and he were able to assist Newbern into the car, according to Sloat’s report. 4/8/2021 UPDATED: $185,000 settlement in Robbinsdale excessive force suit | Public Safety | hometownsource.com https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_post/news/publicsafety/updated-185-000-settlement-in-robbinsdale-excessive-force-suit/article_6f15c68b-0062… 4/4 The March lawsuit also alleges that Sloat’s squad car video “does not show any swerving or other improper driving conduct by Newbern,” and further asserts that a urine test conducted at the Robbinsdale police department was negative for drugs and alcohol. Indeed, results of the test state that, “analysis failed to reveal the presence of ethyl alcohol.” The test results also list cannabinoids, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, and a slew of other drugs as “not detected.” No drugs were listed as “detected.” While being questioned by police after his arrest, Newbern said he did not have any injuries and refused any medical attention from North Memorial Medical Center paramedics, according to Sloat’s report. However, the report also says Newbern’s memory of the events leading up to his arrest – such as the xeld sobriety tests – was murky. Contact Joe Bowen at joe.bowen@ecm-inc.com\n",

One of his }nal Facebook posts stated: \"So sorry,\" and he also uploaded his entire album, \"T.I.M.E.: This Is My Everything.\" This album featured lyrics that some of his friends suggest referred to what was going to happen, including the line: \"Get ready, cuz it’s gonna hurt, right?\" and \"They killed him. This ain’t the way it’s supposed to go. They killed him, and I’m just supposed to be here.\" A married father of a 12-year-old boy, Quinones was a barber as well as a musician, his brother, Joshua Quinones, told KSTP.  His brother also told the TV station that Quinones had been having suicidal thoughts, and he had grown concerned having spoken to him just before the chase and shooting, and tried to reach out to him when he saw his Facebook stream. 3/6/2021 What we know about Brian Quinones, the man shot dead by police in Richfield - Bring Me The News https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/what-we-know-about-brian-quinones-the-man-shot-dead-by-police-in-richfield 2/2 Friends described him to the Star Tribune as a loving family man, though one noted he had struggled in the recent years with \"}nances, his living situation and relationships.\" Quinones lived in Rich}eld, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Of}ce. His Facebook page states he was originally from Ponce, Puerto Rico, though he has lived in Minnesota for a long time and attended high school in the Twin Cities. The City of Edina said that the investigation into his shooting will be conducted by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Of}ce, with more information expected to be released in the coming days. \"The City of Edina grieves alongside the family of the deceased, the of}cers involved and their families, and the Rich}eld and Edina communities,\" its statement said. KARE 11's Lou Raguse notes that Quinones' family is being represented by attorney Robert Bennett, who recently secured a $20 million settlement from the City of Minneapolis over the shooting of Justine Damond.

      "MPR NEWS ›  Annotations   Police ID St. Louis man shot by officers FEBRUARY ೄೇ, ೅ೃೄೆ St. Paul police have identiﬁed the man who was fatally shot by oﬃcers Tuesday after he stabbed a police dog. Alden Anderson, , of St. Louis was being sought by law enforcement on suspicion of ﬁrst-degree criminal sexual conduct. Oﬃcers from St Paul, the North Star Fugitive Task Force, the Ramsey County Sheriﬀ's Oﬃce, and US Marshals were aiding in the search. A police K- named Kody found Anderson in the basement of a Summit-University home, and Anderson stabbed the dog to death. St. Paul police spokesman Paul Paulos said Oﬃcer Jeﬀrey issen ﬁred his weapon and has been placed on standard administrative leave. Two US Marshals also ﬁred their weapons. A spokesperson for the Marshals Service said it does not identify oﬃcers. Paulos said there are no plans to publicly memorialize K- oﬃcer Kody. \"We do let the handlers do their own thing; we consider the dogs one of their family members, so it is a private matter,\" Paulos said. e last time a St. Paul police dog was killed was , he said.

The city’s employee relations committee recommended that the City Council deny the request. The Council will discuss and could take action on the issue at their next meeting on Feb. 7. Carlson, an 11-year veteran of the city’s police force, was on paid administrative leave with the city from April 2015 until he has placed on unpaid leave two weeks ago. During that 21-month stretch he was paid $27.81 an hour (40 hours per week). According to Clerk-Treasurer Harold Langowski, if the City Council accepted Carlson’s resignation, rather than proceed with an investigation and possible termination action, Carlson could also collect the monetary equivalent of 720 hours of sick time accrued while he was on Carlson resigns as Ely police officer - The Timberjay https://www.timberjay.com/stories/carlson-resigns-as-ely-police-officer... 1 of 5 11/22/2022, 1:48 AM paid administrative leave. “The employee relations committee met last week and agreed to recommend to the council to deny the resignation request at this time and have the city attorney proceed with the investigation into a possible termination procedure,” Langowski said. “The city attorney is continuing talks with Carlson’s union representative.” Just before the start of the Jan. 17 jury trial Carlson pleaded guilty to misconduct by a public o\\x01cial, a gross misdemeanor. A felony third-degree sexual conduct charge was dismissed. Later that day, council members placed Carlson on unpaid leave, the initial step in a process that could lead to the termination of his employment. A Feb. 24 sentencing date is scheduled in St. Louis Circuit Court for Carlson on the misconduct charge. Under state law he could be subject to one year imprisonment or a \\x02ne of $3,000. Terms of the plea agreement appear to call for no jail time, with probation and possible \\x02nes. The criminal case against Carlson, 38, who now lives in Aurora, stems from an investigation initiated in the spring of 2015. He was placed on paid leave shortly after the allegations surfaced, and refused requests by the city that he resign. The police department has been operating without a full complement of seven o\\x01cers for almost two years.

      "C C) STATE OF MINNESOTA BOARD OF PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING In the Matter of the FINDINGS OF FACT, Peace Officer License of CONCLUSIONS, AND Alan Knowlton II ORDER License Number: 13490 On June 27, 2000, Administrative Law Judge Beverly Jones Heydinger (“AU”) issued her Findings of Pact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation (“AU report”) in the above- entitled matter (Office of Administrative Hearings Docket No. 15-2402-12888-2). The above entitled matter came before the Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (“Board”) on July 27, 2000. Michele M. Owen, Assistant Attorney General, appeared on behalf of the Complaint Investigation Committee of the Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (“Committee”). Alan Knowlton II did not appear before the Board. Based on all the files, records, and proceedings herein, and having reviewed and considered the written and oral submissions of the parties, the Board makes the following: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. The Board hereby adopts and incorporates as its own the Findings in the AU report, attached hereto and made a part hereof. 2. On May 9, 2000, the Committee served a Notice of and Order for Hearing upon Respondent’s attorney, Dean S. Grau. Upon receipt of the Order for Hearing, Mr. Grau notified Michele Owen, counsel for the Committee, that he no longer represented Alan Knowlton. 3, The Committee arranged for personal service on Mr. Knowlton at 1038 Grant Street, Anoka, Minnesota 55303, the last known address filed with the Board. Persons at that address told the process server that Alan Knowlton no longer lived there. 4. The Post Office informed the Attorney General’s office that Alan Knowlton’s mail was still being accepted at the Anoka address. 0 5. On June 14, 2000, the Notice of and Order for Hearing and Prehearing Conference was sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by first class mail, addressed to Alan Knowlton, 1038 Grant Street, Anoka, Minnesota 55303. The return receipt was received hy the Attorney General’s Office and the notice sent by first class mail was not returned. 6. Respondent Alan Knowlton failed to file a Notice of Appearance with the Administrative Law Judge, failed to appear at the Prehearing Conference scheduled on June 21, 2000, and failed to request that the Prehearing Conference be continued. Therefore, Respondent Alan Knowlton is in default in this proceeding. 4. Pursuant to Minn. R. 1400.6300 (1999), the allegations in the Notice of and Order for Hearing are hereby taken as true. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board makes the following: CONCLUSIONS 1. The Board hereby adopts and incorporates as its own the Conclusions in the AU report. 2.

Montgomery ﬂed the scene before being apprehended a few blocks away. Both men were treated for noncritical injuries. It is still unclear who ﬁred the weapon and whether either man will face criminal charges related to the incident. e Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating Wyatt's use of force and will present its ﬁndings to the Carver County attorney's oﬃce for review, according to a news release.

The investigation determined that Officers Kendrick Mack (Unique 
ID No. 8047), Jacob Roberson (Unique ID No. 7745), and Lieutenant 
Donovan Clements (Unique ID No. 4897) were involved in this incident and 
were treated as the subjects of this investigation.

2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
false arrest claim against Officers Roberson and Mack be 
assigned a finding of “Exonerated.” 
3. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures related to the handcuffing issue against Officer 
Roberson be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and 
recommends, as penalty, a Written Reprimand.

Procedures related to Officer Roberson’s untruthfulness during 
his ACRB Interview when he stated that he did not have an extra 
pair of handcuffs to place on

“Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a Twenty-two (22) 
Day Suspension and Psychological Intervention.

RE: Complaint of

Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on April 27, 2025, Officer Vincent Wallace (Unique ID No. 
8801) conducted an unlawful stop.  
 further alleged that Officer 
Wallace wrongfully issued him a second citation for refusal to sign the initial 
citation. 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of False Imprisonment related to the unlawful 
traffic stop claim be assigned a finding of “Not Sustained.” 
2. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard 
Operating Procedures related to the second citation issue be 
assigned a finding of “Exonerated.” 
 
The Board further determined that APD’s directive, as of March 18, 
2025 (see Exhibit 10 in the Investigative Report), for officers to now cite 
drivers for their refusal to sign a citation is in direct conflict with the APD 
policy 4010, Section 4.3.6.6, which requires officers to write “Refusal to sign” 
on the citation and release the driver.  Not only is the practice of citing drivers 
for their refusal to sign a citation conflicting with APD’s policy, but it is also 
totally misleading and confusing to citizens and officers alike.  Therefore, the 
Board recommends that APD change the policy to reflect the current 
practice.

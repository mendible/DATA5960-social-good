Re:

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the 
alleged actions of Atlanta Police Officer Son Tran on February 22, 2020 and the Board‚Äôs determination. A 
preliminary investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has been 
completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a 
delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed a preliminary investigation into the 
incident subsequent to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter and reached similar conclusions with regard to 
the allegations made by the complainant. Officer Tran was the ‚ÄúBeat Officer‚Äù for Beat 504 on the date of the 
incident. The address of 375 Luckie Street falls within his designated area of responsibility. Between January 1, 
2020 and February 22, 2020 there were eight (8) non-self-initiated calls made in the vicinity of Luckie Street 
related to suspicious persons. The Office of Professional Standards found the claims of harassment made by the 
complainant to be unsubstantiated. 
 
 
The complainant further alleged that after Officer Tran placed him into custody, he drove him to an undisclosed 
location and tightened 
 handcuffs, causing him to drop to his knees in pain. The preliminary 
investigation revealed that Officer W. Adams, a secondary officer, apprehended 
 and initially placed 
him in handcuffs after he ran from the incident location. Officer Adams drove 
 back to the incident 
location and transferred custody of the complainant to Officer Tran. 
 
 
The video evidence shows the complainant expressing pain from the handcuffs that were placed on him upon 
exiting Officer Adams‚Äô patrol vehicle. Officer Tran adjusted the handcuffs appropriately and drove 
 
directly to the Atlanta Detention Center. The complainant did not complain of any further discomfort regarding 
the handcuffs. The Office of Professional Standards agrees with the Board‚Äôs determination of Unfounded on the 
charge of Excessive Force Officer Son Tran. 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the 
concerns of the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

Dear Chief Bryant: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has concluded its 
investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 alleging that on 
November 18, 2019, Officer Carl Miller (Unique ID #7461) discriminated against him when 
he responded to the scene of a motor vehicle accident involving him and another motorist.  
 also alleged that Officer Miller failed to complete an accurate report 
documenting the accident. 
 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Discrimination be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúUnfounded.‚Äù 
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required be assigned a  
finding of ‚ÄúUnfounded.‚Äù  
 
 
The Board also determined that, although the error Officer Miller made in the Motor 
Vehicle Crash Report related to this incident was minor (the officer mistakenly wrote the 
wrong name in the narrative of the report), the Board recommends that the Atlanta Police 
Department remind their officers of the importance of proofreading their reports for accuracy 
before submission. 
 
 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the Ordinance

Dear Chief Bryant: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on February 25, 2020, when Officer David Lopez (Unique ID 
#4619) responded to his residence concerning a dispute he was having with a Georgia 
Power employee, he failed to conduct an adequate investigation.  
 
 
The Board determined the allegation of Appropriate Action Required be

RE: Complaint of 
 
, ACRB File #19-143 
 
Dear Chief Bryant: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 (‚Äúthe Complainants‚Äù) alleging that on 
November 19, 2019, they were unlawfully stopped and detained while crossing 
the street near their residence by Officers Chuma Chapman (Unique ID #5398) 
and Katori Eason (Unique ID #6875). 
 
 
The Board determined the following for both officers: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
unlawful stop claim be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúExonerated.‚Äù 
2. The investigation also determined the officers were in 
Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures 
for failure to notify dispatch of the stop of the Complainants, as 
required by APD.SOP.4010, Section 4.5.1(6)(a), and assigned a 
finding of ‚ÄúSustained.‚Äù 
3. The investigation also determined the officers were in 
Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures 
for failure to activate their assigned Body Worn Cameras 
(‚ÄúBWC‚Äù) during the stop of the Complainants, as required by 
APD.SOP.3133, Section 4.3.4, and assigned a finding of 
‚ÄúSustained.‚Äù   
4. Lastly, the investigation determined the officers were in 
Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures 
for failure to properly document the stop of the Complainants 
on their Daily Activity Reports, as required by APD.SOP.3070, 
Section 4.1.7, and assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained.‚Äù

The Board further recommends, as penalty, that Officer Chapman receives a Written 
Reprimand and Officer Eason receives an Oral Admonishment for each of the three (3) 
sustained violations.  The Board also recommends that both officers appear before two (2) 
separate recruit training classes at APD‚Äôs Training Academy and provide their experiences on 
the importance of activating their BWCs, notifying dispatch and documenting pedestrian stops.  
The Board believes their appearances at the recruit trainings would be a shared learning 
opportunity for the recruits and the officers.

Re:  
Complaint of 
 / ACRB File #19-114 
 
Dear Ms. Tracee McDaniel: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the alleged 
actions of Atlanta Police Officer Jason Whitehead and Sergeant Chukwuma Otiti on September 2, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs 
determination. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation 
of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed an investigation into the incident after receiving 
the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The Office of Professional Standards investigation found Officer Whitehead and Sergeant 
Otiti to be Exonerated on allegations of Appropriate Action Required.  
 
On September 2, 2019, Officer Whitehead responded to the incident location on a domestic dispute call involving the 
complainant. Officer Whitehead advised in his statement to the Office of Professional Standards that a male, who resides 
with the complainant, wanted to press charges against her for damaging his vehicle. During her initial interaction with 
Atlanta Police Officers, the complainant was wearing a ‚Äútank-top‚Äù style shirt with shorts. After running from police officers 
who repeatedly gave the complainant verbal commands to step outside, she locked herself in a bedroom refusing to come out 
until she spoke with a supervisor. Sergeant Otiti responded to the scene to speak with the complainant who then emerges 
wearing a bathrobe, bra, and sweatpants. During the incident, the complainant‚Äôs bathrobe opens, and Sgt. Otiti attempts to 
cover her up with the bathrobe which failed to remain closed. The body-worn camera footage captured during the incident 
does not show any officer leering or staring at the complainant‚Äôs breast as alleged. While speaking with the officers on the 
scene 
 admitted to vandalizing the male‚Äôs vehicle. The complainant was arrested and escorted out of the 
residence by Officer Whitehead who advised that he did not push her. The BWC footage from the various vantage points of 
the responding officers does not show Officer Whitehead pushing the complainant as she alleged.   
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.  
 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Tracee McDaniel: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
 the alleged 
actions of Atlanta Police Officers Anthony Miller and Amasiah Toombs, and the Board‚Äôs determination. This letter serves, in 
accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the 
Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed an investigation into the incident after receiving 
the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The investigation found Officer Anthony Miller to be Exonerated on the allegation of 
Conformance to Directives, specifically APD.SOP. 3060 Reports and Report Writing, Section 4.1.6.  
 
 
On August 16, 2019, Officer Miller responded to a 911 call involving the complainant. Upon arrival, he spoke with 
 
 who advised him that she was in a dispute with a female that she was planning to evict from her apartment. The 
complainant advised Officer Miller that she wanted a police report to document that the police responded to her residence. 
Officer Miller advised the complainant that there is a record of his response (for example the CAD Report and his BWC 
footage) and further advised her that the dispute was civil in nature. In his statement to the Office of Professional Standards, 
Officer Miller advised that he explained the eviction process and the Temporary Protection Order process to the complainant. 
He further advised that he believed that he had discretion when deciding whether to complete a police report.  
 
Atlanta Police Department Standards Operating Procedures (specifically, APD.SOP.3060 Reports and Report Writing, 
Section 4.1.6 When to Make a Report) provide guidelines on when Atlanta Police Department sworn personnel are required 
to make a report. The Body Worn Camera (BWC) footage related to the incident along with the statement that Officer Miller 
provided to the Office of Professional Standards indicate that Officer Miller understood the Report Writing policy and did not 
violate the Atlanta Police Department Conformance to Directives Work Rule.  
 
 
The complainant also alleged that she was falsely arrested by Officer Toombs on August 17, 2021. 
 was arrested 
by Officer Toombs after she made a verbal threat against her roommate in the presence of officers who responded to her 
residence on a dispute call. Officer Toombs was separated from the Atlanta Police Department prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs 
letter.

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the alleged actions of 
Atlanta Police Officer Jay Pagan, Danny Padron, Carlos Miret, Dustin Autry, and Marcus Forsten on April 12, 2020, and the 
Board‚Äôs determination. The Atlanta Police Department conducted and completed an investigation into the incident prior to 
receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of 
Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Office of Professional Standards investigation found Officers Pagan, Padron, and Miret to be ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on 
allegations of Appropriate Action Required. The investigation revealed that the actions of the officers were justified, lawful, 
and within Department policy. Though the officers were not formally accused of Harassment, Retaliation and False 
Imprisonment (Officer Pagan) or Excessive Force (Officers Forston, Padron, Miret, and Augtry) the Office of Professional 
Standards agrees with the Board‚Äôs findings of ‚ÄúNot Sustained‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnfounded‚Äù respectively. Sufficient evidence was not 
produced during the investigation to sustain the violations.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.  
 
 
Sincerely,

was partnered with Officer Stevens, laughed while Officer Stevens attempted to 
remove him from his vehicle.   
 
 further alleged that on September 6, 2019, when he went to the

The Board determined the following as it relates to Sergeant Keeney:

The Board further recommends that the Atlanta Police Department (‚ÄúAPD‚Äù) do the 
following:  
 
1. Provide the ACRB with a written explanation as to why 
 
complaint was not handled in accordance with APD.SOP.2020, Section 
4.3.1 as it involved an excessive force allegation that should have been 
investigated by APD‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards and not 
forwarded to the Zone 3 supervisory staff to handle. 
2. Explain why the other allegations in 
 complaint were not 
addressed. 
3. Remind its supervisory staff the importance of choosing their words 
wisely when speaking to citizens so they do not give the citizens the 
impression that they are not being impartial and not taking their 
complaint seriously.

actions of Atlanta Police Officers Caddell Stevens and Jack Wright on September 5, 2019, the alleged actions of Sergeant 
Redmond Keeny on September 6, 2019, and Board‚Äôs determination. The Atlanta Police Department received and completed 
an investigation into the incidents prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. This letter serves, in accordance with 
Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police 
investigation of the event.  
 
 
The Atlanta Police Department found Officer Stevens to be Sustained on an allegation of Atlanta Police Department Work 
Rule 4.2.33, Conformance to Directives, specifically APD.SOP.3133, Section 4.3.4 Body Worn Camera (BWC). The 
investigation revealed that on September 5, 2019 Officer Stevens failed to activate his BWC as required per APD Policy on a 
self-initiated call involving an illegally parked vehicle on Washington Street. Subsequently, Officer Stevens received and 
served a one-day suspension.  
 
 
The preliminary investigation conducted by the Office of Professional Standards revealed a potential violation of the Body 
Worn Camera policy by Officer Stevens. Similarly, to the Board‚Äôs determination, the preliminary investigation conducted by 
the Office of Professional Standards did not find sufficient evidence to sustain allegations of Excessive Force or Conduct 
against Officer Stevens. The Office of Professional Standards preliminary investigation also did not find sufficient evidence 
to sustain the allegation of Conduct against Officer Wright as it relates to him laughing or smirking during the incident on 
September 5, 2019.  
 
 
Lastly, the Office of Professional Standards agrees with the Board‚Äôs determination of Unfounded against Sgt. Keeney on the 
allegation of Appropriate Action Required. Sgt. Keeney documented the complaint of Mr. 
 and forwarded it to the 
Office of Professional Standards as required per Atlanta Police policy. Based on the findings during the preliminary 
investigation, Mr. 
s complaint was forwarded to the Zone 3 Precinct for investigation.  
 
 
Within the Board‚Äôs determination letter is a recommendation to remind the supervisory staff of the Atlanta Police Department 
of the importance of choosing their words wisely when speaking to citizens so they do not give the citizens the impression 
that they are not being impartial and not taking their complaint seriously. I accept this recommendation. I appreciate the

 alleging that on March 30, 2020, during an incident at Wal-Mart involving Mr. 
and an unidentified male, Officer Darvin Diaz-Taylor (Unique ID No. 6889): 
(1) failed to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, (2) falsely arrested him, 
(3) engaged in excessive force in that he lifted his handcuffed arms in an upward 
motion behind his back to search him, causing him pain, and (4) applied the handcuffs 
too tight. 
 
The investigation also determined that Lieutenant Alneta Harris (Unique ID 
No. 3195) was involved in this incident, and was therefore, also deemed a subject.  
 
 
The Board determined the following as it relates to Officer Diaz-Taylor: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the false 
arrest claim be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, 
as penalty, an Oral Admonishment. 
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
inadequate investigation claim be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù 
and recommends, as penalty, an Oral Admonishment and Training 
on how to handle critical incidents. 
3. The allegation of Excessive Force related to the lifting of 
 
arms be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, as 
penalty, a four (4) day suspension and Training on Use of Force. 
4. The allegation of Excessive Force related to the tight handcuffs claim 
be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúNot Sustained‚Äù. 
5. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù against Officer 
Diaz-Taylor for failure to report the use of force that occurred during 
the incident to the Zone supervisor, as per APD.SOP.2010, Section 
4.2.52 & APD.SOP.3010, Sections 4.6.4 & 4.6.7.  The Board

The Board determined the following as it relates to Lieutenant Harris: 
 
1.  The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the inadequate 
investigation claim be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, 
as penalty, a Written Reprimand and Training on how to handle critical 
incidents. 
2.  The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù against Lieutenant Harris

handcuffed arms behind his back at a height that caused him to yell out 
loudly, several times, that he was in pain, as per APD.SOP.2010, Section 
4.2.3.(2). The Board recommends, as penalty, a sixteen (16) day suspension 
and appropriate remedial supervisory/leadership training to improve 
her supervisory performance. 
 
The Board further recommends that the Atlanta Police Department do the following: 
 
‚Ä¢ 
ensure that Lieutenant Alneta Harris and Officer Darvin Diaz-Taylor 
received refresher training on how to conduct a proper search on handcuffed 
arrestees, specifically when it necessitates the officer to move an arrestee‚Äôs 
arms for the discovery of a weapon or a poking object; and 
‚Ä¢ 
ensure that Officer Diaz-Taylor receives refresher training on Use of Force 
reporting.  
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation 
for action by the Board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the Ordinance 07-0-0141).

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of Mr. 
, the alleged actions 
of Atlanta Police Officers Adonis Gibson and Melvin Harris on July 1, 2015, and the Board‚Äôs determination. The Atlanta 
Police Department conducted and completed an investigation into the incident prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination 
letter. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action 
taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department found Officer Melvin Harris to be ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on the allegation of the Atlanta Police 
Department‚Äôs Use of Firearms Work Rule. The investigation determined that Officer Harris‚Äô actions were justified, lawful 
and within Department policy. Officer Gibson resigned from the Atlanta Police Department on May 15, 2019 prior to the 
completion of the OPS investigation; thus, the allegation of Use of Firearms against Officer Gibson was ‚ÄúExceptionally 
Closed.‚Äù The findings of the Office of Professional Standards investigation are similar to the Board‚Äôs findings of 
‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on the allegation of Excessive Force against both Officers Gibson and Harris.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of Mr. 
, the alleged actions of 
Atlanta Police Lieutenant Alan Gruen and Sergeant Thomas Apple on November 11, 2014, and the Board‚Äôs determination. 
An investigation into the incident was conducted and completed prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. This 
letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with 
respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department found Lieutenant Alan Gruen to be ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on the allegation of Use of Firearms. The 
investigation determined that Lieutenant Gruen‚Äôs actions were justified, lawful and within Department policy. This 
disposition mirrors the Board‚Äôs determination of ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on the allegation of Excessive Force.  
 
Also, within the Board‚Äôs determination letter, is a finding of ‚ÄúNot Sustained‚Äù on the allegation of Abusive Language against 
Sergeant Apple. Although Sgt. Apple was not formally accused of violating the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Courtesy work 
rule, the Office of Professional Standards agrees with the findings of the Board. The investigation did not develop sufficient 
evidence to sustain the allegation that Sgt. Apple directed profanities at the complainant during the incident.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.  
 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Chief Bryant: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by Mr. 
, alleging that on December 6, 2019, Officer Jerontee Jackson 
(Unique ID No. 6237) unlawfully detained him. 
 
 
The Board determined that the allegation of False Imprisonment be 
assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, as penalty, an Oral 
Admonishment. 
 
 
The Board further determined that based on the evidence obtained 
during the investigation, Officer Jackson was in Violation of Department 
Standard Operating Procedures 2010, Section 4.1.3 as it pertains to 
truthfulness and assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, as 
penalty, a sixteen (16) day suspension.  The statement Officer Jackson 
provided to the ACRB does not reflect what actually occurred regarding the 
presence of a gun on 
 when he detained and handcuffed him.  The 
Body Worn Camera footages captures the entire pat-down of 
 and 
despite Officer Jackson‚Äôs assertion that a gun was secured during the pat down, 
the footages do not show the recovery of a gun during the pat down or a gun 
being secured.  Moreover, Officer Jackson‚Äôs partner statement does not support 
Officer Jackson‚Äôs assertion that a gun was recovered from 
 
person.

Re:

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of Mr. 
, the alleged 
actions of Atlanta Police Officer James Douglas on October 2, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs determination. A preliminary 
investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has been completed. This letter serves, in 
accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the 
Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department conducted and completed an investigation into the incident prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs 
determination letter. The Atlanta Police Department found Officer Douglas to be ‚ÄúNot Sustained‚Äù on an allegation of 
Maltreatment or Unnecessary Force. The investigation did not produce sufficient evidence to sustain the finding that Officer 
Douglas committed the violation. This disposition is similar to the Board‚Äôs finding of ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on the allegation of 
Excessive Force against Officer Douglas. The Board also found Officer Douglas to be ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù on the allegation of 
Appropriate Action Required related to the complainant‚Äôs claim that he was falsely arrested. Officer Douglas‚Äô actions were 
legal, justified, and within Department policy. Although Officer Douglas was not formally accused of Appropriate Action in 
the Office of Professional Standards investigation, the Office of Professional Standards agrees with the Board‚Äôs 
determination.  
 
Lastly, the Board found Officer Douglas to be ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù on an allegation of Abusive Language stemming from the incident 
involving the complainant on October 2, 2019. The Office of Professional Standards agrees with the Board‚Äôs determination 
while recognizing the volatile nature of high stress use of force situations. All Department employees will be reminded that 
they shall be civil, orderly, and courteous to the public and shall not use coarse, insensitive, abusive, violent, or profane 
language when performing official duties including those that involve the use of force.   
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

Re:  
Complaint of 
 / ACRB File #20-076 
 
Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the 
alleged actions of Atlanta Police Sergeant LaWanda Giles on November 21, 2020 and the Board‚Äôs determination. 
A preliminary investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has been 
completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a 
delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has completed a preliminary investigation into 
the incident subsequent to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The Office of Professional Standards agrees 
with the Board‚Äôs determination of Not Sustained on the charges of Conduct and Abusive Language against Sgt. 
Giles. The preliminary investigation revealed that there is insufficient evidence to Sustain these allegations. 
 
The Board also provided a determination of Sustained on two allegations of Violating Department Standard 
Operating Procedures against Sergeant Giles due to her failure to activate her Body Worn Camera when she 
interacted with the complainant and her failure to notify the dispatcher that she was working an Extra Job on 
November 21, 2020. A formal investigation into the actions of Sergeant Giles would determine which 
departmental policies, if any, were violated and the appropriate discipline for any sustained allegations; however, 
a formal investigation is not warranted because Sergeant Giles is no longer employed by the Atlanta Police 
Department. I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made 
aware of the concerns of the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

Dear Chief Bryant: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by Mr. 
, alleging that on December 6, 2019, Officer Jerontee Jackson 
(Unique ID No. 6237) unlawfully detained him. 
 
 
The Board determined that the allegation of False Imprisonment be 
assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, as penalty, an Oral 
Admonishment. 
 
 
The Board further determined that based on the evidence obtained 
during the investigation, Officer Jackson was in Violation of Department 
Standard Operating Procedures 2010, Section 4.1.3 as it pertains to 
truthfulness and assigned a finding of ‚ÄúSustained‚Äù and recommends, as 
penalty, a sixteen (16) day suspension.  The statement Officer Jackson 
provided to the ACRB does not reflect what actually occurred regarding the 
presence of a gun on 
 when he detained and handcuffed him.  The 
Body Worn Camera footages captures the entire pat-down of 
 and 
despite Officer Jackson‚Äôs assertion that a gun was secured during the pat down, 
the footages do not show the recovery of a gun during the pat down or a gun 
being secured.  Moreover, Officer Jackson‚Äôs partner statement does not support 
Officer Jackson‚Äôs assertion that a gun was recovered from 
 
person.

Dear Chief Bryant: 
 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) 
has concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by Mr. 
 alleging that on December 11, 2019, Officer Kenneth 
Thomas (Unique ID No. 4847) showed a lack of impartiality when he failed 
to assist him when he responded to a call involving him and an Atlanta 
Ambassador Force employee who had threatened him.  
 
 
The Board determined the allegation of Appropriate Action 
Required be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúNot Sustained.‚Äù 
 
 
The Board also determined that while there is no evidence to support 
or refute 
 claim that Officer Thomas was ‚Äúimpartial‚Äù or 
‚Äúbias,‚Äù there is certainly a measure of speculation for 
 to 
believe that he would have had his complaint handled without prejudice, had 
another officer responded to the scene that, at the time, was not working an 
extra job for the Ambassador Force.  The Board recommends that the APD 
address the matter of having officers, who are working their extra jobs, 
responding to incidents that involve complaints against the companies‚Äô staff.

Re:  
Complaint of

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, 
the alleged actions of Atlanta Police Officer Kenneth Thomas on December 11, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs 
determination. A preliminary investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards 
has been completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, 
as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has completed a preliminary investigation into 
the incident after receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The Office of Professional Standards agrees with the 
Board‚Äôs determination of Not Sustained on the allegation of Appropriate Action Required. Sufficient evidence 
could not be produced during the Atlanta Police preliminary investigation to sustain the allegations made by 
 
. There is no evidence to support the allegation that Officer Thomas showed a lack of impartiality 
when he responded to an incident involving the complainant and an Atlanta Ambassador Force employee.  
 
Within the boards letter is a recommendation for the Atlanta Police Department to address the matter of having 
officers, who are working their extra jobs, respond to incidents that involve complaints against the company‚Äôs 
staff. In Officer Thomas‚Äô interview with the ACRB, he advised that he works an extra job for the Atlanta 
Downtown Improvement District (ADID). He further advised his responsibilities include conducting patrols and 
assisting Ambassadors when confronted with escalated situations that require the need for a law enforcement 
officer.  
 
When Officer Thomas responded to the call involving the complainant and an Atlanta Ambassador Force 
employee on December 11, 2019, his response was within the scope of what he advised were his extra job duties. 
It is stated in the ACRB investigation that ‚Äúone could understand 
s perception that Officer 
Thomas arrived with a lack of neutrality simply because he was working for them at the time.‚Äù All Atlanta Police 
Officers are required and trained to perform official acts in a lawful, restrained, dignified, impartial, and 
reasonable manner. This directive does not exclude extra job employment.

Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
. 
 alleging that on July 10, 2019, Officer Danny Padron (Unique ID 
No. 6986) committed the following acts: (1) engaged in excessive force when he 
forcefully pulled him from the ground, pulled his hair and shoved him inside the

Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the 
alleged actions of Atlanta Police Officer Danny Padron on July 10, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs determination. An 
investigation conducted by the Atlanta Police Department has been completed. This letter serves, in accordance 
with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the 
Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards conducted and closed an investigation into the 
incident prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. Though Officer Padron was not formally accused of 
the allegations listed in the Board‚Äôs determination letter (Excessive Force #1, Excessive Force #2, Excessive 
Force #3, Appropriate Action Required, and Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures), the 
Office of Professional Standards agrees with the relative findings of the Board (Unfounded, Not Sustained, Not 
Sustained, Unfounded, and Not Sustained).  
 
In the Office of Professional Standards investigation, the complainant alleged that while operating an Atlanta 
Police patrol vehicle, Officer Mark Graham, who was partnered with Officer Danny Padron on July 10, 2019, 
chased the complainant, who was operating a scooter, and struck him with the patrol car. The Atlanta Police 
Department found Officer Mark Graham to be ‚ÄúNot Sustained‚Äù on both the allegation of Violation of Department 
Standard Operating Procedures as it relates to the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Pursuit Policy and the allegation of 
Operation of City Vehicles. Sufficient evidence could not be produced during the Atlanta Police preliminary 
investigation to sustain the allegations made by

Board‚Äôs determination of Exonerated on the Excessive Force allegations made by 
 against Officers 
Bivins, McKinnon, and Jackson. The complainant also alleged that she was unlawfully detained; however, Body 
Worn Camera footage shows 
 fleeing into oncoming traffic while officers were speaking with her giving 
the officers lawful cause to detain the complainant. These findings are congruent with the Board‚Äôs finding of 
Exonerated on the allegation of False Imprisonment.

Re:  
Complaint of 
 / ACRB File #21-024 
 
 
Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the alleged 
actions of Atlanta Police Officer Toney Chambers on February 28, 2021, and the Board‚Äôs determination. A preliminary 
investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has been completed. This letter serves, in 
accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the 
Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed a preliminary investigation into the incident 
prior to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. Within the Board‚Äôs letter, the Board found Officer Chambers to be 
Sustained on an allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures specifically APD.SOP.2010, Sections 
4.2.18 and 4.2.17 as they relate to the claim that he failed to respond to the complainant‚Äôs son‚Äôs car accident in a timely 
manner. Sufficient evidence could not be produced during the Atlanta Police preliminary investigation to sustain the 
allegations made by 
.  
 
The corresponding Call for Service Report and 911 Radio Traffic indicate that at 9:48 PM Officer Chambers was initially 
dispatched to a hit and run accident at Interstate 75/85 North Bound at John Lewis Freedom Parkway. Officer Chambers 
advised the dispatcher at 9:59 PM that he was on scene as he searched the area for the caller‚Äôs vehicle. At 10:04 PM Officer 
Chambers advised dispatch that he was unable to locate the vehicle. Officer Chambers requested for the dispatcher to place a 
retuned call to the caller to obtain more information regarding the caller‚Äôs location and subsequently parked his patrol vehicle 
inside of a nearby parking lot while he awaited a reply from the dispatcher. At 10:11 PM the dispatcher advised that the ‚ÄúCall 
Back‚Äù went to voice mail and Officer Chambers advised that he would conduct an additional search for the vehicle which 
was eventually located at Interstate 75/85 South Bound at John Lewis Freedom Parkway at 10:18 PM.  
 
Officer Chambers was initially dispatched to the incorrect location. He is seen on his Body Worn Camera Footage actively 
searching the interstate for the accident and relocating to a place of safety when his efforts were unsuccessful to request and 
wait for the dispatcher to do a ‚ÄúCall Back‚Äù to obtain more information regarding the caller‚Äôs location. The dispatcher was 
unable to reach the caller; however, Officer Chambers continued searching until he discovered an accurate location for the 
caller. The actions of Officer Chambers were within reason and did not appear to violate Atlanta Police policy.

Dear Chief Bryant: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) 
has concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 alleging that on September 12, 2020, while he was waiting to 
park his vehicle in front of the Red Martini Restaurant and Lounge, Atlanta 
Police Officer James Gikanga (Unique ID No. 7013): (1) unlawfully detained 
him and (2) falsely arrested him for Laying Drag and Reckless Driving.  
 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of False Imprisonment related to the unlawful 
detainment claim be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúExonerated‚Äù.  
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
false arrest claim be assigned a finding of ‚ÄúNot Sustained‚Äù. 
3. Officer Gikanga failed to advise 
 the reason for the 
traffic stop when he approached his vehicle, as per 
APD.SOP.4010, Section 4.5.1(10), and assigned finding of 
‚ÄúSustained‚Äù, the Board recommends, as penalty, an Oral 
Admonishment and Training on How to Properly Conduct 
Traffic Stops. 
 
 
The Board further recommends that the APD remind its officers of the 
traffic stop procedures, particularly, advising citizens of the reason(s) for the 
stop at the outset of the stop, unless there are extenuating circumstances.

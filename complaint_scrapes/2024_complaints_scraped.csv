RE: Complaint of 
, ACRB File 
No. 23-125 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
alleging that on July 30, 2023, Officer John Hurst (Unique ID No. 7837), who 
responded to her vandalism call, showed a lack of courtesy when he refused to remove 
his patrol car from her lawn and when he told her, “Don’t call me again!” 
 
The board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Conduct related to the officer’s refusal to move his 
patrol car off Ms. 
 lawn be assigned a finding of “Sustained” 
and recommends, as penalty, a Written Reprimand, Training on 
Interpersonal Skills, and Counseling. 
2. The allegation of Conduct related to the officer’s statement to Ms. 
, “Don’t call me again” be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and 
recommends, as penalty, a One (1) Day Suspension. 
3. The allegation of Conduct related to the officer’s comment that was 
capture on his body worn camera (“BWC”) and not in the presence of 
Ms.
 “I fucking hate people dude, you want my help, but you want 
to treat me like a dick? Get the fuck outta here dude,” be assigned a 
finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a Three (3) 
Day Suspension. 
4. The allegation of Violation of Departmental Standard Operating 
Procedures related to the officer’s failure to comply with Ms. 
 
and her family member’s numerous requests to notify his supervisor 
and request that his supervisor come to the scene be assigned a finding 
of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a Three (3) Day 
Suspension.  
The board further recommends that given Officer Hurst’s behavior that was 
captured by his BWC and his superior officer’s comment to Ms. 
 about not being 
surprised by Officer Hurst’s behavior that the APD reassess whether Officer Hurst is 
psychologically and emotionally fit to be a police officer.

Additionally, the board recommends that Officer Hurst receive citizen engagement training 
that is reflective of the department’s goal of demonstrating the highest standards of professionalism 
in law enforcement. 
 
Furthermore, due to the egregious nature of Officer Hurst’s actions, the board requests that 
the APD expediate their review of this matter. 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief of 
Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation 
for action by the board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the Ordinance 07-0-0141).

RE: Complaint of 
, ACRB File 
No. 23-056 
 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on February 28, 2023, Officers Jarrett Sievers (Unique ID No. 
7528) and Shea Schafer (Unique ID No. 7261) falsely arrested him.  Mr. 
 
further alleged that Officer Darvin Diaz-Taylor (Unique ID No. 6889) harassed 
him on several occasions when he threatened to arrest him. 
 
The board determined the following  
 
1. The allegation of Harassment against Officer Diaz-Taylor be 
assigned a finding “Exonerated.” 
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
false arrest claim against Officers Sievers and Schafer be 
assigned a finding of “Exonerated.” 
3. The allegation of Abusive Language against Officer Sievers be 
assigned a finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, 
an Oral Admonishment and Counseling. 
The board further recommends that the APD remind officers of the public’s 
first amendment rights to record/observe officers’ actions per APD policy.  While 
it may be uncomfortable to the officer, the citizen’s actions must be at the level of 
obstruction as balanced against the citizen’s first amendment rights.

Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has

Christopher Tanner (Unique ID No. 2012), of the Atlanta Police Department (“APD”),

The board determined that the allegation of Violation of Departmental 
Standard Operating Procedures against Officer Tanner be assigned a finding of 
“Sustained” and recommends as penalty an Oral Admonishment. 
 
The board further recommends that the APD ensure all officers, including 
those who are in their Atlanta Retired Police Reserve program, are aware of their 
policies that prohibit smoking while on duty and in public view. 
 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the 
Chief of Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, 
rejected, or will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the

RE: Complaint of 
, ACRB File No. 23-
141 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has concluded 
its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 alleging that on 
August 24, 2023, while at the Georgia World Congress Center, Atlanta Police Department 
(“APD”) Sergeant Eric Northern (Unique ID No. 2562), was discourteous towards her 
when he approached her and started yelling at her while she was trying to allow a 
passenger to exit her transport vehicle. 
 
The board determined the following: 
1. The allegation of Conduct related be assigned a finding of “Unfounded.” 
2. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures related to the officer’s failure to activate his body worn 
camera be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as 
penalty, a three (3) day suspension.  
It should be noted that the board is aware that Sergeant Northern has been 
disciplined on this allegation and received a Written Reprimand as penalty; however, the 
board determined that the penalty was not sufficient, and the officer should have been 
disciplined based on APD’s body worn camera policy and received a three-day suspension.  
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
of Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or 
will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the Ordinance 
07-0-0141).

RE: Complaint of

No. 23-160 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
alleging that on September 22, 2023, an unidentified black female Atlanta Police 
Department (“APD”) officer displayed a lack of courtesy and respect when she spoke 
to her in a rude and aggressive manner.  The investigation determined that APD 
Officer Michaela Herring (Unique ID No. 7867) or Sergeant Tiffany Hampton (Unique 
ID No. 6464) may have been involved in this alleged incident and were therefore 
treated as the subjects of this investigation. 
 
The board determined that the allegation of Conduct against Officer Williams 
and Sergeant Hampton be assigned a finding of “Unfounded.” 
 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the 
Chief of Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, 
rejected, or will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the 
submission of a recommendation for action by the board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-

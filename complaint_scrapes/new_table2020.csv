Dear Chief Shields: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by the male 
complainant alleging that on June 23, 2019, Officer Che Milton (Unique ID #6824) 
engaged in excessive force when he slammed him on the ground causing him to sustain 
injuries to his face.  The complainant also alleged that during the incident, Officer 
Milton was verbally abusive towards him when he called him a ‚Äústupid ass 
motherfucker.‚Äù   
 
The complainant further alleged that Officer James Gikanga (Unique ID 
#7013) abused his authority when he told him that if he filed a complaint against 
Officer Milton, he would arrest him.  
 
Furthermore, it is noted that the investigation also identified Retired 
Investigator Dexter Dumas (Unique ID #0332) as a subject. 
 
 
The Board determined, as it relates to Officer Milton, the following: 
 
1.  The allegation of Excessive Force be assigned a finding of 
Sustained. 
2.  The allegation of Abusive Language be assigned a finding of 
Sustained. 
3.  The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating

Procedures related to the officer‚Äôs failure to notify a supervisor after 
using force on Mr. Sanders, as per SOP3010, Section 4.5.7, be 
assigned a finding of Sustained. 
 
The Board is aware that the APD also conducted an investigation into this 
incident and sustained all of the aforementioned allegations.  The Board also 
agreed with the disciplinary action of Termination as the appropriate penalty 
imposed on the officer.

required by SOP2010, Section 4.2.53, be assigned a finding of Sustained. 
3.  The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures related to

Sustained. 
 
 
The Board recommends, as penalty, the officers receives a Written Reprimand and a three (3)

him to work at the incident location as required by SOP.2060, Section 4.2.1 be assigned a 
finding of Sustained and recommends that an Oral Reprimand be imposed as the

handle calls whereby the incident involves a citizen‚Äôs allegation against an officer who 
was already on the scene. Thus, the APD‚Äôs Training Unit should examine this issue and 
provide a response to the Board pertaining to Officer Gikanga‚Äôs claim.  
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief respond in 
writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be implemented with 
modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation for action by the Board to the

Re: APD OPS File # 19-C-0311-UAF / ACRB File # 19-074 
 
 
Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence:  
 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
 
 the alleged actions of Atlanta Police Officers Che Milton, James Gikanga, and Investigator 
Dexter Dumas on the 23rd of June 2019, and the Board‚Äôs determination. An investigation by the Atlanta 
Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards was conducted. This letter serves, in accordance 
with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect 
to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event. 
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards conducted an investigation into the 
incident parallel to the Board‚Äôs investigation. The Office of Professional Standards completed its 
investigation and the three involved personnel were charged accordingly, much like they were by the 
Board with its charges. 
 
Officer Che Milton was charged with violations of Reporting Required When Force Used, Standard of 
Conduct, Conformance to Directives (Extra Jobs), Conformance to Directives (Report Writing), and 
Unnecessary Force. Officer Milton was Sustained on all these violations. Officer Milton was dismissed 
from the Atlanta Police Department for his actions in this incident. 
 
Investigator Dexter Dumas was charged with violations of Conformance to Directives (Extra Jobs), 
Conformance to Directives (Supervisor Notification), and Conformance to Directives (Report Writing). 
C I T Y  O F  A T L A N T A
Investigator Dumas was Sustained on all these violations. He has subsequently concluded his Retired 
Recapture contract position and is no longer employed by the Atlanta Police Department. 
 
Officer James Gikanga was charged with violations of the Unsatisfactory Performance policy and the 
Appropriate Action Required policy. Officer Gikanga was Sustained on both violations. He faced 
suspensions for both violations as discipline. 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware 
of the concerns of the Board.  Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

  RE: ACRB File #19-025 
     
Dear Chief Shields: 
 
             Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by a male complainant 
alleging that on March 5, 2019, Officers Matthew Jean-Pierre (Unique ID #6035) and 
Rawdon Lorde (Unique ID #6291) unlawfully stopped and searched his vehicle.    
 
 
The Board determined the following as it relates to Officer Jean-Pierre: 
 
1. The allegation of False Imprisonment related to the unlawful stop and 
detainment claim be assigned a finding of Not Sustained. 
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the illegal 
search claim be assigned a finding of Sustained and recommends, as 
penalty, a Written Reprimand and Training on Search and Seizures. 
3. The Board also determined that Officer Jean-Pierre provided untruthful 
testimony during his ACRB interview when he stated Mr. Rivers‚Äô 
Probation Officer, Danny McMillian, gave him permission to search his 
vehicle because he had relinquished his 4th amendment rights due to 
felony charges and he had a signed waiver on file. Therefore, a finding 
of Sustained was assigned to the allegation of Violation of Department 
Standard Operating Procedures, specifically, APD.SOP.2010, Section 
4.1.3 and recommends, as penalty, Five (5) Days Suspension.

investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by a female complainant alleging that 
Officer Dwayne Thomas (Unique ID #7104) failed to submit a completed and accurate report 
pertaining to a hit and run traffic accident she was involved in on May 22, 2019.  She further 
alleged that Officer Thomas failed to place a lookout on the vehicle that left the scene of the hit 
and run.   
 
 
The Board determined the following:

Board notes that issue was similarly raised and sustained in ACRB file 18-035

Re: APD OPS File # 19-C-0337-MISC / ACRB File # 19-068 
 
 
 
Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence:  
 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
 
, the alleged actions of Atlanta Police Officer Dwayne Thomas on the 22nd of May 2019, and the 
Board‚Äôs determination. An investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional 
Standards has been completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta 
Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of 
the event. 
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed an investigation into the 
incident subsequent to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The Office of Professional Standards 
determined Officer Dwayne Thomas to be Sustained on a charge of Appropriate Action Required 
stemming from 
 
 allegation. Officer Thomas had failed to relay a lookout for the vehicle that 
had left the scene of the accident and he had failed to properly classify the report as a Hit & Run 
accident report, per APD.SOP.4010 Traffic ¬ß4.18.11 Hit and Run.   
 
The Office of Professional Standards agrees with the Board‚Äôs determinations of Sustained on its charges 
of Appropriate Action Required and Violation of SOP (Lookout on Hit & Run vehicle). However, both 
the requirement for giving a lookout over radio for a Hit & Run vehicle and the classifying of the report 
properly as a Hit & Run accident are part of the same policy subsection: 
 
C I T Y  O F  A T L A N T A
APD.SOP.4010 Traffic  
4.18.11 Hit and Run 
(CALEA 6th ed. standard 61.2.1c & 61.2.2b) 
 
When the collision involves a hit-and-run, the officer will do the following, in addition to the 
procedures in Section 4.19.2: 
 
1. Place a lookout for the suspect vehicle with radio dispatch; including description of the 
driver, if available, and damage to the vehicle. 
 
2. Obtain necessary information that is relevant to the Hit and Run; such as, listing all 
evidence and observations collected at the scene. Be sure to mark ‚Äúhit and run‚Äù on the 
Motor Vehicle Accident Report completed on ICIS. The ICIS Motor Vehicle Accident 
Report (DMVS-523) will be forward by Central Records for processing, then forwarded to 
the Accident Investigation Unit via ICIS Case Management for further investigation. 
 
As such, the Office of Professional Standards only charged Officer Thomas with the single Appropriate 
Action violation. The report written was accurate, notwithstanding the above error and any clerical error. 
The Board‚Äôs recommendation to review the policy has been taken under advisement. 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware 
of the concerns of the Board.  Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the 
alleged actions of Atlanta Police Sergeant James Hines on May 1, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs determination. This letter 
serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with 
respect to the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed an investigation into the incident before 
receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. Similar to the findings of the Board, the Office of Professional Standards 
recommended that Sgt. Hines be Sustained on allegations of Maltreatment or Unnecessary Force, Appropriate Action 
Required, Conformance to Directives (APD.SOP.3030 Arrest Procedures 4.1.6), and Conformance to Directives 
(APD.SOP.3020 Search and Seizure 4.3.1). The Department recommended that Sgt. Hines be dismissed for violating 
the Maltreatment or Unnecessary Force Work Rule. The Department also recommended that Sgt. Hines be suspended 
for fifteen days (three five-day suspensions for each allegation) for violating the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs 
Appropriate Action Required, Conformance to Directives (APD.SOP.3030 Arrest Procedures 4.1.6), and Conformance 
to Directives (APD.SOP.3020 Search and Seizure 4.3.1) Work Rules. Sgt. Hines resigned in lieu of termination; thus, 
the investigation was ultimately Exceptionally Closed.

Please  be  advised  that  the  Atlanta  Citizen  Review  Board  (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù)  has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by  
 
alleging that on April 5, 2019, Officers Che Milton (Unique ID #6824) and John Kelton 
(Unique ID #7167) failed to act when they responded to her apartment complex to 
investigate her 911 call involving her neighbor. 
 
 further alleged that on April 6, 2019, Officer Milton failed to act 
when he, again, responded to her apartment complex to investigate her 911 call involving 
the same aforementioned neighbor. 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the April 5th 
incident against Officers Milton and Kelton be assigned a finding of 
Unfounded. 
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the April 6th 
incident against Officer Milton be assigned a finding of Sustained and 
recommends, as penalty, an Oral Admonishment. 
3. The Board also determined that Officer Milton was in Violation of 
Department Standard Operating Procedures when he failed to record 
his conversation with one of the involved parties during his investigation 
of the April 6th incident as required by APD.SOP.3133, Section 3.10. 
Therefore, the allegation was assigned a finding of Sustained and the 
Board recommends as penalty, a Written Reprimand. 
 
Furthermore, the Board takes note that during the April 5th incident, Officers 
Milton and Kelton performed exceptionally well with handling this highly stressful 
incident and the APD may want to consider giving the officers a letter of commendation 
for the handling of the April 5th incident.

completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a 
delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed a preliminary investigation into the 
incident subsequent to receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The Office of Professional Standards agrees 
with the Board‚Äôs determination of Exonerated on the charge of Appropriate Action Required against Officer 
Brooks. His actions during the encounter with the complainant were appropriate and did not violate departmental 
policy.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the 
concerns of the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

Re:  
Complaint of 
 / ACRB File #19-119 
 
Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the 
alleged actions of Atlanta Police Officer Bennie Baskin on October 4, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs determination. A 
preliminary investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has been 
completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a 
delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards has completed a preliminary investigation into 
the incident after receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. Within the Board‚Äôs letter, it is recommended that 
Officer Baskin be Sustained for Appropriate Action Required because he failed to attempt to obtain statements 
from everyone who was involved in a dispute call that he responded to on October 4, 2019.  
 
The preliminary investigation revealed that the actions of Officer Baskin were within Department policy. Officer 
Baskin responded a call involving two sisters who engaged in a verbal dispute with the property managers at the 
location. Officer Baskin spoke with the property managers who advised him that the sisters were no longer on 
scene. The property managers also provided him with descriptions of the vehicles driven by each sister. A brief 
visual canvas for the vehicles described by the reporting parties, in addition to their statements confirming that the 
sisters were no longer on scene, would lead a reasonable officer to believe that the sisters were no longer present 
at the location.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the 
concerns of the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.  
 
Sincerely,

Dear Interim Chief Bryant: 
¬†
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on October 6, 2019, Officer Karl Jean-Baptiste (Unique 
ID #5460) failed to investigate his 911 call for assistance.  
 further 
alleged that Officer Jean-Baptiste laughed at him when he reported that a woman 
gave him a fake $100 bill. 
 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The Allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
failure to investigate issue be assigned a finding of Sustained and 
Recommends, as penalty, a Written Reprimand and Training 
on How to Conduct Preliminary Investigations. 
2. The Allegation of Conduct related to the laughing issue be 
assigned a finding of Unfounded. 
3. The Board also determined that Officer Jean-Baptiste was in 
Violation of Department Standard Operating Procedures when 
he failed to write an Incident Report documenting Mr. Rodriquez‚Äôs 
fraud allegation as required by APD.SOP.3060, Section 4.1.6 and 
assigned a finding of Sustained.  Thus, the Board recommends, as 
penalty, an Oral Admonishment.

Dear Interim Chief Bryant: 
 
             Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (‚ÄúACRB‚Äù) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on July 24, 2019, Officer Jonathan Larca (Unique ID #5446) and 
Detectives Carlos Smith (Unique ID #3279) and Ivory Streeter (Unique ID #3923) 
abused their authority when they came to her residence in an attempt to harass and 
intimidate her. The investigation also identified Sergeant Kelly Lambert (Unique ID 
#2654) as a subject. 
 
 
The Board determined that the allegation of Abuse of Authority against Officer 
Larca and Detectives Streeter and Smith be assigned a finding of Exonerated. 
 
 
The Board also determined that the allegation of Violation of Department 
Standard Operating Procedures (‚ÄúSOP‚Äù) against Sergeant Lambert be assigned a 
finding of Sustained and recommends, as penalty, an Oral Admonishment.  Sergeant 
Lambert failed to document 
 complaint when she called the precinct to 
complain about said officers pertaining to this incident in violation of APD.SOP.2020, 
Section 4.2.2(3)(A). 
 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the 
Chief respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or 
will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the

Re:  
Complaint of 
 / ACRB File #19-092 
 
Dear Ms. Cecilia Houston-Torrence: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board‚Äôs letter regarding the complaint of 
, the alleged 
actions of Atlanta Police Officer Jonathan Larca, Detective Carlos Smith, Detective Ivory Streeter, and Sergeant Kelly 
Lambert on July 24, 2019, and the Board‚Äôs determination. A preliminary investigation by the Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs 
Office of Professional Standards has been completed. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta 
Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department‚Äôs Office of Professional Standards completed a preliminary investigation into the incident 
after receiving the Board‚Äôs determination letter. The preliminary investigation revealed that the actions of Officer Larca, 
Investigator Streeter, and Investigator Smith were within Department policy. The Office of Professional Standards agrees 
with the Board‚Äôs determination of Exonerated on the allegation of Abuse of Authority against Officer Larca and Detectives 
Streeter and Smith. 
 
Within the Board‚Äôs letter, it is recommended that Sergeant Lambert be Sustained for Violating a Department Standard 
Operating Procedure, due to his failure to document 
 complaint when she spoke to him via telephone about 
the above referenced July 24, 2019 incident. The preliminary investigation revealed that Sergeant Lambert did not interpret 
his conversation with 
 as a complaint against a member of the Atlanta Police Department. Sgt. Lambert 
expressed in his ACRB interview that 
 conversation focused on the actions taken by the apartment complex, 
specifically a representative who brought Detectives Streeter and Smith to her residence. It was not until Sergeant Lambert‚Äôs 
ACRB interview, given on October 22, 2019, that he discovered that the individual he believed to be a property agent was 
Atlanta Police Officer Johnathan Larca. Given these circumstances, formally accusing Sergeant Lambert was not deemed 
appropriate.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.  
 
 
Sincerely,

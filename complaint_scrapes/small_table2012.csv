RE: Complaint of Abera Gebru, ACRB File 11-75 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (ACRB) has concluded its 
investigation and adjudication of the complaint  filed by Abera Gebru alleging that Atlanta 
Police Officers David Matteson (Badge 4448) and William Kellner (Badge 4565) falsely 
arrested him and used abusive language towards him during an incident that occurred on 
October 14, 2011 at 255 Auburn Ave.  The Board determined that there was sufficient 
evidence to sustain the false arrest allegation against Officers Matteson and Kellner and 
recommends the following discipline be imposed: 
 
• 
False Arrest – Officer Kellner – Written Reprimand 
• 
False Arrest – Officer Matteson – Written Reprimand 
 
The Board determined that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the abusive 
language allegation.  
 
It is the Board’s understanding that Officers Kellner and Matteson received discipline 
on the above allegation prior to the Board’s decision and recommendation; therefore, 
pursuant to City Ord. Sec. 2-2211 (M)(4), the Board submits this letter only as an official 
notification of the Board’s action on the complaint.   
 
The file is available for review upon request.  
 
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me or Lee Reid at 
(404) 865-8622.

Ms, Kelly was issued two citations, one for improperly\n‘marked drive-out tag and one for a child safety requirement.

She further stated that she\n‘was informed by Sergeant Branum (at least she believed it was Sergeant Bramum) that\nthis was a police vehicle pursuit. Investigator Boyd reported that Officer Gleason\nreported thatthe vehicle had sped up to 60 miles per hour before the crash,\n\nInvestigator Boyd interviewed the other passenger inthe car, Anthony Price.

RE: Case #09-01 / Complaint of Alma George 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation and 
adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Alma George alleging that Officer 
Figueroa unlawfully caused the death of her nephew, Pierre George on December 18, 
2008.   
 
Ms. Alma George filed a timely complaint alleging, “death which is alleged to 
be the result of the actions of an employee of the Department.”  There was initial and 
significant delay in receipt of the files from the Atlanta Police Department.  A subpoena 
was issued and the files were ultimately delivered in June 2009.  These files were 
reviewed.  The results of the investigation were further delayed when the District 
Attorney charged Jesus Galarza with involuntary manslaughter and his attorney would 
not allow her client to be interviewed.  A decision was made to wait until after the 
criminal trial or adjudication in order to ascertain the exact nature of Mr. Garlaza’s 
statements to Officer Figueroa.  This investigation was conducted by a thorough review 
of the records provided by the Homicide Unit and the District Attorney’s Office.   
 
Sergeant Vasquez of the Homicide Unit conducted the initial interview of Jesus 
Galarza.  He admitted that he called the police and reported that he was being kidnapped 
at gunpoint.  He explained on video tape that when the car was stopped by the police, 
Mr. George got out of the car and kept going to his waist band like he was trying to get 
something out.  He heard one shot and saw Mr. George run from the car.  
 
John Wright was a passenger in the car.  He was interviewed by members of 
the Homicide Unit on the day of the incident.  He indicated that he was picked up at a 
gas station by Pierre George and they agreed to purchase crack cocaine.  They 
encountered a Hispanic man who willingly walked to the car and got into the car.  They 
went to a couple of locations looking for crack cocaine and smoke crack cocaine twice.  
Mr. George purchased the drugs and left the car twice.  Mr. Garlaza remained in the car.  
He explained that Pierre George was driving the car and at some point while they were 
leaving an apartment complex, a patrol unit started to follow them.  The patrol unit tried

to pull the car over but Mr. George would not stop.  The car eventually pulled over and the 
patrol car pulled in behind them.  Mr. George tried to push the patrol car with his car and the 
officer told him to remain in the car.  Mr. George opened the driver’s side door and advanced 
towards the officer and Mr. Wright heard a shot.  After this interview was conducted, the 
Homicide Unit detectives allowed Mr. Wright to leave.  They later realized that Mr. Wright’s 
statement conflicted with Mr. Garlaza’s and they re-located him and brought him back and 
charged him with felony murder, robbery and false imprisonment.  The charges were 
subsequently dismissed and Mr. Garlaza was then charged with Involuntary Manslaughter by 
the Fulton County District Attorney.   
 
Officer Figueroa was interviewed by Sergeant Vazquez in the presence of his 
attorney.  He explained that he received a lookout on a wine colored car involved in a 
kidnapping.  He spoke to the victim via cell phone.  Mr. Garlaza does not speak English and 
Officer Figueroa speaks Spanish.  He explained that Mr. Garlaza indicated that he was 
kidnapped at gun point by a black man.  He described his location and Officer Figueroa lost 
contact with the caller.  He tried to call him back four or five times and at about 6:12 AM he 
called his phone and Mr. Garlaza answered.  He told him his location and Officer Figueroa 
notified the dispatcher and proceeded to the area.  He saw the car and he pursued the car and 
it stopped behind a business on Cheshire Bridge Road.  He boxed the vehicle in and the 
driver of the car put the car into reverse and struck the patrol car.  Officer Figueroa got out of 
the car with his weapon drawn.  He approached the driver’s side of the car and Mr. George 
with both hands near his lap and fidgeting.  He ordered him to let him see his hands and he 
ordered him to step out of the car.  Mr. George opened the driver’s side door and got out of 
the car and had his right hand at his waist band.  He ordered Mr. George to get on the ground, 
but he did not comply and his right hand was still at his waistband.  He observed Mr. George 
trying to pull something from his waistband and he believed that he was armed.  He fired one 
shot from his firearm from about four to five feet from Mr. George.  Mr. George ran towards 
Cheshire Bridge Road and Officer Figueroa ordered the front passenger (Wright) out of the 
car. 
 
The District Attorney charged Mr. Garlaza with involuntary manslaughter.  His 
attorney would not allow the ACRB to interview him.  At his plea hearing on August 26, 
2010, he admitted to fabricating the kidnapping story and the contention that George was 
armed.  He was asked why he did this.  He replied that he was under the influence of drugs 
and did not foresee the consequences.  He was sentenced to a five year term of imprisonment.  
This admission supports the legal justification for the deadly force used by Officer Figueroa.   
Thus, the Board recommends a finding of Exonerated with regard to the Deadly Force. 
 
Additionally, this investigative file was sent to Elite Performance Auditing 
Consultants.  This group of attorneys has substantial experience in auditing police use of 
deadly force.  They examined the file and made some observations about the tactics used by 
the Atlanta Police Department.  They were particularly critical of the delay in interviewing 
Officer Figueroa.  They also faulted the investigator for not asking Officer Figueroa why he 
did not wait for backup and continued to approach the suspect’s vehicle.  This appears to be a 
violation of S.O.P. 4010 at 4.5.2.  This policy requires the officer to not attempt a traffic stop 
of a car wanted in connection with any felony until a backup unit arrives.  It also requires the

officer to use the public address system or to speak loudly and order the occupants to place 
their hands behind their heads.  They suggest that this should have been addressed as a 
training issue while adjudicating the complaint.   
 
The report also stated that the officers did not collect and preserve evidence.  The 
investigative report indicated that a homicide sergeant observed what appeared to be the end 
of a crack pipe at the scene of the incident.  The item was photographed but not listed in the 
APD property/evidence/inventory report.  The Board considered these recommendations and 
agrees that these policy and training issues should be addressed by the Atlanta Police 
Department. 
 
The ACRB agreed that the Use of Deadly Force allegation be exonerated; however, 
the Board recommends that the practice of delaying officer interviews be abandoned and that 
the Atlanta Police Department conduct a tactical analysis after each shooting to ensure that 
officers are conforming to Standard Operating Procedures. 
 
I enclose a copy of the audit conducted by Elite Performance Auditing for your 
information.   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to have a copy of the full 
investigation.  The ordinance requires the Chief to respond in writing regarding which 
recommendations are accepted, rejected or will be implemented with modifications within 
thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.

The reason that he was stopped was that he mated the\ndescription of a bank robbery suspect. Mr. Stewart complained that the officers\n‘engaged in unnecessary and excessive force when they grabbed him, pulled him\nto the ground and handcuffed him, He contends thatthe force used by the officers\n|vas unnecessary because he cooperated with the officers throughout the stop.\n\nOfficers Wilson and Bahry were working departmentally approved extra jobs at\nthe time of the stop. Officer Skillman was on a regular tour of duty with the\n‘Atlanta Police Department. The officers submitted written statements to their\nSupervisor after Mr. Stewart complained to the Zone Commander an the ACRB\n‘considered the written statements, The officers appeared in the ACRB after being\nsummoned and refused to answer any questions after being advised of their\n‘constitutional rights.\n\n“The Board considered all the evidence and the applicable law and poliy.

Some force may have been reasonable, however,\nthe officer failed to thoroughly investigate the matter prior to using the force and\nthe actions were not proportionate to the resistance. Mr. Stewart was not\n‘combative and there was no threat to the officers. Since the officers refused to\nsubmit to interviews, the complainant's version of the incident was deemed more\ncredible.\n\nFor the above reasons, the ACRB decided by a unanimous vote to Sustain the\nAllegation of Excessive Foree against Officers Skillman, Wilson and Bahry.

The Board received the\n‘complaint on April 9, 2009, Review of the matter was suspended nti the criminal case\nagainst Mr. Perdue was adjudicated. On October 20, 2009, the Board's investigator\ncontacted the City Solicitor’ Office and was informed that tha the criminal case against\n(Me. Perdue was dismissed for insufficient evidence, The complainant was then contacted\nand an interview was conducted.\n\n‘Mr. Perdue stated that on Noverber 18, 2008 at about 9:30 a.m, he was on the porch of,\nhis parents residence located at 661 Brookline Street, SW, Atlanta when a police car\nparked in the driveway. Mr. Perdue stated that two police officers approached him and\nasked if they could question him regarding some previous burglaries inthe neighborhood,\nHe tod them that the house belongs to his parents and advised them tht they were on\nprivate property. The officers told him that he looked ou of place. Officer Gonzalez\nasked him some questions conceming whether he used drugs and whether be had any\n‘warrants outstanding. Me. Perdue said that he replied in the negative and Officer\nGonzalez then asked for his name and address. He provided that information to the\nofficer. Inthe meantime, Officer Harris went to the patrol car and retuned and informed\nthem that Mr, Perdue had an oustanding warrant. Mr. Perdue was handcuffed and placed\ninthe back seat ofthe patrol car, Mr, Perdue alleges that Officer Harris came to where he\n‘was siting reached into his (Officer Harris's) pocket, pulled out a small bag, shoved it in\nhis (Perdue’s) face and asked i belonged to him. Mr. Perdue said that he replied,\n\n‘55 Trinity Avenue, SW | City Hall Tower | Suite 9100 | Atlanta, GA 30303 | ww.acrbgov.org | 404-865-8622\n"", '“No,” adding that he was not aware of what was inthe bag. The officers dove him tothe\nPre-Trial Detention Center. Mr. Perdve thought that he was arrested for an oustanding\n‘warrant. He was informed by a sergeant at the jail, however, that he was being arested\nfor possession of marijuana\n\n“The investigation revealed that the officers conducted a record check on Mr. Perdue on\n[November 12, 2008. The check revealed that Mr. Perdue had no outstanding warans\n‘The ACRB investigator attempted to locate the police report associated with this atest\nnd was told that there was no report on file. The Records Unit advised the ACRB to\n‘contact the Zone 3 Commander fr assistance, Major Finley was contacted and onthe\nsame day, December 28, 2008, the ACRB received a copy ofthe police report. The\nreport was dated December 29, 2000; more than a year after the incident occurred. It\nindicated that it was a “replacement report,” however there was no record that a police\nreport was ever generated prior tothe one that was received. Lastly, the date listed onthe\nreport as to when the incident occured was incomect. The replacement report noted that\nthe date of the incident was November 10,2008. The Chain of Custody report for the\n‘drugs was dated November 12, 2008. The drugs were submitted tothe Property Control\n{Unit but had not been analyzed. According to the court records, the case against Mr.\nPerdue was dismissed for lack of a police report.\n\nOfficer Deontaye Haris and Luis Gonzalez did not cooperate with the ACRB\'s\ninvestigation. They appeared but refused to answer any questions about the incident.\n“The report submited a year after the incident stated thatthe officers observed Mr. Perdue\n‘making preparation to smoke marijuana. There were no independent witnesses and the\nofficers faire to submit to an iterview lft the complainants version ofthe events\nuuncontroverted.\n\n“The Board considered the evidence at heir meeting on March 11,2010. They voted\n‘unanimously to Sustain the allegation of False Artest against Officers Harris and\nGonzalez. They considered the unusual circumstances which resulted in the dismissal of\nthe criminal charges against Mr, Perdue. ‘The Board had no reliable evidence that the\n“officers had made an arest based on probable cause. False Ares is defined inthe\n‘ordinance as,""an ares by police officer of the wrong person without probable cause to\nbelieve crime has been committed andor without a warrant andor when the atesting\nparty knowingly holds someone who has not committed a crime.” Additionally the\nfailure file the incident report ina timely manner isa violation of departmental\nprocedures.\n\n“The Board then considered the officers’ disciplinary and complaint history. Officer\nDeontaye Harris has been employed as a police office since 2002. During this time,\nthere have been twelve (12) complaints filed against him inthe Office of Professional\n‘Standards. All but one of them has been adjudicated, Five of the complaints were for\nfailure to appear. He has received oral admonishments and a two (2) day suspension for\nfailure to appear in court. Additionally, he received a five (5) day suspension for\n‘Unauthorized Use of Force in 2004, The Department also sustained a complaint against\n\n', ""him for falsifying records, He received a three (3) day suspension for this offense in\n2006. The Board considered Officer Haris history and considered the disciplinary\n‘guidlines forthe Atlanta Police Department While the guidelines indicate tha this\n‘offense may merit a three day suspension for “abuse of authority.” the Board exceeded\nthe guidelines in ts recommendation because the finding involves very serious\nallegations which reflect upon the officer's honesty. His prior record raises doubts about\nhis moral character and integrity. Certainly the charge that he planted illegal drues on\nizemis disturbing and merits further consideration. Foe these reasons, the Board voted\n‘unanimously to recommend that the Chief of Potice impose a suspension of twenty (20)\nworking days without pay. This isthe harshest discipline recommendation that the Board\nhas ever submitted to the Chief, The Board makes this recommendation because the\n‘officer’ significant disciplinary history and the current complain reflect negatively upon\nhis integrity and moral fitness forthe job of Atlanta Police Office.\n\n‘officer Gonzalez's disciplinary history was then considered by the Board. Officer\n‘Gonzalez has been employed since 2004, He has been the subject of eight (8) complaints\nto the Office of Professional Standards. All eight complaints involve allegations of\n‘excessive foree. None have been sustained, One is open.

RE: 
09-07 Complaint of Darryl Momon 
Dear Chief Pennington: 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (""ACRB"") completed its investigation and adjudication of the 
complaint that was filed by Darryl Momon. Mr. Momon alleged that on December 23, 2008 he arrived at 
the Kroger Shopping Center located at 3030 Headland Drive to assist his daughter who had been involved 
in a motor vehicle accident. Allanta Police Officer Roderick Jonson determined that Mr. Momon's 
daughter was at fault in the accident. 
Mr. Momon claims that his daughter became upset and he 
intervened and tried to calm her. Officer Johnson told Mr. Momon to step away but he continued to talk 
to his daughter and was arrested after Mr. Momon asked for the name of his supervisor. He was charged 
with disorderly conduct. 
Officer Johnson's report indicates that Mr. Momon physically resisted when he was placed under arrest. 
Mr. Momon denied this. The criminal charges were dismissed upon the motion of the prosecution. 
Officer Johnson declined to answer questions regarding this matter in the ACRB office. The Office of 
Professional Standards provided a copy ofthe statement that he made regarding this complaint. 
Other witnesses included Mr. Momon's son and daughter. They stated that their father did not resist 
arrest and was not aggressive towards the officer. Jasmine Brown-Smith and Brittney Marrox were 
interviewed. They were passengers the car driven by Mr. Momon's daughter. Their recollections were 
vague; however, they both recalled the officer repeatedly asked Mr. Momon to step away. The witnesses 
claim that Mr. Momon continued to be argumentative and refused to obey the officer. They stated that 
Mr. Momon did not resist the officer. 
The ACRB considered all the available evidence and voted unanimously to recommend that the allegation 
of False Arrest against Officer Johnson be not sustained. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would like to have a copy of the 
investigation. The ordinance requires that the Chief respond in writing regarding which recommendations 
are accepted, rejected, or will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the 
submission of a recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief. See Sec. 2-2211 IO} of 
Ordinance 07-0-0141.

There was no indication in the\nPolice report or the interview conducted with Officer Nelson that this occurred.\n‘This requirement is further explained in the Atdanta Police Department 8.0 P.\n3030 4.1.3. This procedure requires officers to comply with the United States\n‘nd Georgia Constitutions.

The fact that Officer Esquilin declined\n(o answer questions makes it difficult to assess the credibility of his written report.\nFor that reason, the allegation of excessive force was sustained against Officer\nFrank Esquilin, The allegation of excessive force against Officer Lewis was not\nsustained. ‘The Board further voted to recommend that the Chief impose a one day\nsuspension on Officer Esquilin, This is consistent with the Department's disciplinary\npolices.\n\n‘The Board expressed concems that there is some confusion as to whether sergeants\nare required to file Use of Force reports when officers point firearms at a person.

RE:  Atlanta Eagle Bar Complaints 
 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The purpose of this letter is to apprise you of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board 
(ACRB) decisions regarding the complaints made by persons who were present at the 
Atlanta Eagle Bar on September 10, 2009.   
 
The Board received twelve complaints.  The first complaint considered by the 
Board was from David Shepherd (10-16).  Mr. Shepherd complained that he was falsely 
arrested while in his apartment.  Mr. Shepherd is an employee of the Eagle Bar but he was 
not working on the night of the arrest.  He lives upstairs from the bar in an apartment and 
was home on that evening.  The Board recommended a finding of Sustained against the 
officers who participated in his arrest, Sergeant Brock and Investigator Bridges.  This Board 
further recommended that you impose a three day suspension on each of the two officers in 
order to address this violation.  This recommendation was sent to you in a letter dated June 
14, 2010.  You responded by explaining that the matter was still under investigation at the 
Office of Professional Standards.   
 
The Board reviewed the investigation into the complaints filed by Robert Kelley 
and Ernest Buehl on August 12, 2010 (Complaints #09-36 & #09-38).  Mr. Kelley is an 
owner of the Eagle Bar and Mr. Buehl was working as a door man on the night of the arrest.  
Their complaints involve the use of abusive language by members of the Atlanta Police 
Department.  Mr. Kelley alleged that he heard officers say the following: 
 
1. When he asked about his rights, an officer responded, “you are a fag and you 
have no rights.” 
2. When he and others asked why they were detained, they were told to, “shut 
the fuck up.” 
3. He heard an officer say, “raiding a fag bar was fun and they should do this 
every week.” 
4. He heard an officer threaten to hit a patron with a bar stool if he did not shut 
up. 
 
Continue please…

Mr. Buehl heard a customer asked about why he was being detained and an 
officer responded that, if he didn’t put his head down and shut the fuck up, the officer 
was going to take a bar stool and knock him down.   
 
Many of the fifteen (15) employees and patrons that were interviewed heard 
the same language. 
 
The ACRB staff interviewed twenty-four (24) of the officers present.  All of 
the officers denied using this type of language and all denied hearing another officer 
say the words reported.  A series of photo arrays were viewed by Mr. Robert Kelley.  
He identified Officer Brandon Jackson, a member of the RED DOG Unit as one of 
the officers who uttered an obscenity.  He additionally selected another officer who 
was not present at the Eagle Bar.   
 
The Board considered all of the evidence.  They voted to sustain the 
allegation of abusive language.  All of the patrons and employees heard similar 
language.  While it appears that Officer Jackson had some culpability, the Board was 
of the opinion that the supervisors should be held responsible for this type of conduct.  
The Board voted to hold their disciplinary recommendation in abeyance until they 
can get more information regarding the responsibility and knowledge of the 
supervisors. 
 
The third group of complaints considered by the ACRB concerned the patrons 
of the Eagle Bar.  The Board received nine (9) complaints from people who were 
present when the police arrived (Complaints #09-34, #10-08, #10-09, #10-10, #10-11, 
#10-12, #10-13, #10-14, #10-15).  These nine complainants had no ties to the 
management of the bar and were not identified by officers as being involved in any 
criminal activity.  They complained that they were subjected to abusive language and 
that they were falsely imprisoned.  The investigation revealed that all of the patrons 
were placed on the floor.  Many of the officers provided different estimates of the 
time that the patrons were detained varying from 10 minutes to one hour.  Criminal 
record checks of all of the patrons commenced at 23:20 and ended at 23:49.  Most of 
the patrons explained that they spent some time on the floor before being told to 
produce their identification.  The patrons had their identities checked and were 
released after the officers completed that task.  The officers indicated that they 
arrived at the bar between 10:45 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.  Thus, the patrons were 
detained between 30 minutes to an hour, depending upon when their identification 
was checked.  The twenty four police officers did not indicate that any of the patrons 
who made complaints committed an offense.   
 
Continue please …

The Board considered the evidence of abusive language and decided to 
sustain the complaint against the officers.  The Board further decided to study and 
consider the supervisory responsibility concerning this issue before making a 
recommendation about discipline.  Similarly, the Board voted to sustain the 
allegation of unlawful imprisonment against all of the officers who were present.  
It is uncontroverted that the police officers conducted a detention, if not an arrest, of 
the patrons.  In order to detain a person, there must be objective facts establishing 
reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect was involved in criminal activity.  The 
standard must be particularized; that is that you may not detain everyone in a bar 
because one person may have committed an offense.  The detention must be 
“justified at its inception and reasonably, related in scope, to the circumstances which 
justified the interference in the first place.”  U.S. v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 682 
(1985).   
 
This operation violated APD.SOP. 3020, Section 4.3.3 and the corresponding 
Fourth Amendment law, particularly with regard to the patrons of the bar since there 
was no articulable suspicion or probable cause to believe that the patrons committed 
or were about to commit a crime.  
 
The Board has not made disciplinary recommendations regarding the 
complaints of Mr. Kelley and Mr. Buehl or the nine patrons.  We are currently 
studying the role of supervisors and other violations of Standard Operating 
Procedures.   
 
Please let me know if you have any concerns regarding this issue.   
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Joy Morrissey

She arrived atthe residence and\n‘observed Mr. Tigner in custody and bleeding from his nose and mouth. She asked for an\nambulance and she claims tha the sergeant refused 10 call one. She died 911 and\n‘requested the ambulance and when the modics arrived she claims that the sergeant old\n‘them to only check his vital signs because he needed to go to jail and not the hospital\nMs. Knighton said that the EMS left and Mr. Tigner continued to have difficulty\n‘breathing. and the sergeant requested that the ambulance return. Mr. Tigner was\n‘tansported to Grady Hospital. While Ms. Knighton identified one ofthe witnesses, she\n‘could not provide contact information for the otber witnesses.\n\nMr. Tigner claims that he was standing on the side of his mother's residence\ntalking when two Atlanta Police Officers approached and one ofthe offices struck him\nfn the fice.

He denied being inside the residence where\nthe warrant was being served and claimed that he did not jump out of a window a8,\nalleged by the officers. He said he didnot run from the police nor offer resistance, He\nfiled a complain withthe Office of Professional Standards.\n\nSergeant Jeff Branum, Investigator David Stribling, and Investigator Peter\n“Trott initially refused to answer questions. On May 17, 2010, an ordinance requiring\nthe Chief of Police to discipline offices who do not cooperate was passed by the City\n‘Council, The officers were summoned again and gave statements\n\nAtlanta, GA 30303 | www.2crbaov.org | 402-865-8622\n\nCity Hall Tower | Suite 91\n"", ""Chief George Turner\nRE: Case 809-37.

He said that he was responsible for the perimeter and was\naccompanied by Investigators Trotta and Stribling. He was advised by Investigator Stribling\nthat a black male, later identified as Exzavirous Tigner, jumped out of a side window of the\nhouse in an effort to evade officers. He claims that Tipner ran tothe rear of the adjacent\nhouse and was followed by Investigator Stabling. He and Investigator Trott ran othe front\nof the adjacent house and chased Mr. Tigner for three to five houses down the srect before\nthey confronted him. Investigator Trott tackled Tigner and took him to the ground\nSergeant Branum sad that when Trotta tackled Tigner, his (Trtta’s) shoulder harness that\nsecures his gun belt came disengaged, causing him to become distracted. According to\nSergeant Branum, Investigator Stribling arrived and assisted Trott in handeuffing Tigher.\nSergeant Branum said that he saw Tigner fll at different times. He didnot know where the\nblood came from, Sergeant Branum advised that he completed an APD Use of Force report\nbecause ofthe injuries sustained by Mr. Tiger.\n\nInvestigator Trotta explained that he was near the front ofthe house when he heard\nInvestigator Stribling radio that someone jumped from window of the house and that the\nsubject was running towards the rear of an adjacent house. ‘Tosta said that he ran and saw\n“Tigner jump over fences. He upholstered his firearm and ordered Tigner to the ground. He\nthen holstered his weapon and moved toward Tigner and tackled him tothe ground and this\ncaused his gun belt hamess to become dislodged. He became distracted and Investigator\nSeribling and Sergeant Branum assisted him,\n\nInvestigator Stribling said that he was at the rear of the house when he heard\n‘crashing sounds a few seconds after the police entered the residence. He saw Mr, Tigner’s\nface in the bushes with his feet up inthe window seal. Mr. Tigner rolled over, got on his feet\n‘and began to run. Mr. Tiger jumped several fences until he was stopped by Investigator\n‘Trota. He assisted Trota and placed his knee in Tigner’s back and placed Mr. Tigner’s arm\n‘behind his back in order to take him into custody. He saw blood near Mr. Tigner's mouth\n‘nd said that Tignes facial injuries may have been caused by the fll from the window of\nthe house.\n\nSergeant Tony Jones reported that he was a pat ofthe etry team that went into the\nhouse at 1620 Westwood Avenue. He did not observe the arrest of Mr. Tigner nor did he\nobserve any force used against him. He observed the ambulance come twice and he said tht\nthe saw scratches and bleeding from Mr, Tigner’s nose, He did not know how Mr. Tigner\nreceived the injures,\n\n‘The witnesses that may have seen this incident could not be located. Mr. Tgner pled\nguilty tothe charges of possession of marijuana, possession of cocaine and abstrction of law\nenforcement on November 24, 2009\n\nGiven the conflicting evidence produced by the investigation, ACRB voted\n‘unanimously to recommend a finding of Not Sustained. Itis worthy of note that the injuries\nsustained by the complainant were not consistent with the fll thatthe officers described. He\nhad bilateral bruising wo his face and according 1o one Board member, who isa physician, it\n‘very unlikely dhat he fll on both sides of his face.

However, because of the nature ofthe\n‘ituation, EMS personnel called the police and Officer Marin responded, Officer\nMartin advised Ms, Williams that she could not evict Ms. Adams from her home\n‘without proper eviction proceedings. He advised her that he did not want have\nto return to deal with this matter and left, However, the argument with Ms. Adams\nContinued. Ms. Adams called 911 and told the call taker that she was being beaten\nby Ms. Willams. Ms, Williams gained control of the phone nd told the cal taker\n‘what was happening.

Ms. Williams alleges that he rushed in without speaking, grabbed her, threw\nhher to the floor, placed his knee into her back and handcuffed her. There was\nanother officer there but she could not identify him. Both she and Ms. Adams\n‘were arrested and charged with Disorderly Conduct. The charges were dismissed\nthe following day when Ms. Adams and Williams agreed to reconcile their\ndifferences,\n\n“The 911 calls that were recorded corroborate Ms. Williams’ version of the nature\nofthe call. The radio transmission also indicate that when Officer Marti.\nreceived the second cal, he advised that he was en route and to send a wagon.\n‘Ms, Adams stated that three police officers instructed Williams to put her hands\nbbchind her back, threw her in a chair, kneed her inthe back, pulled her down to the\nfloor and handcuffed her.

When asked about the second call tothe residence,\nhhe said that it was reported that there was a fight. He said that Ms. Williams was\n{acting in ""a violent manner,” however when asked to explain, he said that she was\nJoud and using choice words. He did not observe them fighting.

RE: Case #10-04, Complaint of Julius Rawls 
 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation and 
adjudication of the complaint alleging excessive force that was filed by Mr. Julius Rawls 
against Officer Charles Yacuone.   
 
Mr. Rawls was interviewed in prison because he was convicted of the criminal 
charges that originated his complaint.  He said that he was in the parking lot of the Citgo 
Gas Station on the corner of Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway and Harwell Road on 
September 12, 2009.  Two Atlanta Police cars approached and approximately six 
officers exited the vehicles and ordered him to put his hands behind his back.  According 
to Rawls, he held up his hands and the officers handcuffed him, threw him on the ground 
and struck him in the head and face.  He could not identify which of the officers struck 
him because he was stunned.   He was treated at Grady Hospital and the medical records 
indicate that Mr. Rawls suffered a contusion to the orbit of his right eye and no 
documented fractures.  He was treated with medication and released to the jail.   
 
Officer Malecki and Officer Johnson were part of the takedown team that was 
conducting an undercover narcotic operation.  Officer Malecki explained that they 
participated in an undercover buy of cocaine and they purchased the drugs from Mr. 
Rawls.  When they approached Mr. Rawls, it appeared that Mr. Rawls placed the 
cocaine in his mouth.  Malecki said they ordered Rawls to place his hands behind his 
back and he resisted arrest.  He and Officer Johnson took him to the ground.  They 
called an ambulance because it appeared that Rawls had ingested the cocaine.  When 
asked about the injury sustained by Mr. Rawls, he said that he recalled that Mr. Rawls 
had a bump near his right eye and said that the area where Rawls was taken to the 
ground was on a slope and contained rocks and Mr. Rawls may have injured his eye 
during the arrest.  He said he did not strike Mr. Rawls in the face and he did not observe 
any other officer strike Rawls in the face. 
 
Continue please…

Officer Yacuone stated that he was involved in an undercover narcotic operation and 
said that he did not observe the actual arrest because he was assigned to the second arrest 
team and by the time he arrived on the scene, Rawls was already in custody.  He observed 
Mr. Rawls become agitated and officers took him to the ground to control him after he was 
handcuffed.   
 
Officer William Johnson stated that he and officer Malecki were involved in a “buy 
bust” and Officer Malecki approached Mr. Rawls and he observed Rawls blade his physical 
stance as if he was going to resist arrest.  According to Officer Johnson, Rawls resisted being 
handcuffed and he was taken to the ground to control him.  It was on a steep incline and both 
he and Rawls fell down during the struggle.  He could not recall if Mr. Rawls was injured due 
to the fall or if Rawls suffered any injury.  He said that he did not strike Mr. Rawls in the face 
and did not see any other officer strike him.  An ambulance was called because Mr. Rawls 
was suspected of having swallowed crack cocaine. 
 
Mr. Robert Jenkins was interviewed.  Mr. Rawls reported that Jenkins was a witness.  
He was working at a nearby business.  He observed two officers approach Rawls and they 
tried to handcuff him.  Rawls fell to the ground.  He heard Mr. Rawls question the officers 
about why he was detained, but did not see Mr. Rawls attempt to flee or strike the officers.  
He did not see the entire interaction because he was working.  He directed the investigator to 
the slope where the officer and Mr. Rawls had fallen and the investigator observed that there 
were numerous small rocks. 
 
Mr. Rawls was arrested for the illegal sale of narcotics.  A use of force report was 
completed.  The officers denied striking Mr. Rawls in the face and the injury to Mr. Rawls’ 
eye may have occurred as a result of the struggle.  Therefore, the ACRB voted to recommend 
that the allegation of Excessive Force against the involved officers be “not sustained.”   
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to have a copy of the full 
investigation.  The ordinance requires the Chief to respond in writing regarding which 
recommendations are accepted, rejected or will be implemented with modifications within 
thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.

RE:  Complaint #10-07 / Domice Irving 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“the ACRB”) completed its 
investigation and adjudication of a complaint against Detective Andrew 
Silberman.   
 
Mr. Domice Irving complained that he was falsely arrested by Detective 
Silberman on September 29, 2009 at 855 Coleman Street.  He said that he was 
hired by the homeowner to perform yard work; however, when he arrived, the 
owner was not home so he waited on the porch.  He explained that shortly 
thereafter, approximately fifteen (15) Atlanta police officers arrived, ordered him 
to the ground and handcuffed him.  The officer entered the residence and found 
illegal drugs.  Irving said that the officers took him inside the residence and 
ordered him to put on some of the occupant’s clothing in an attempt to establish 
that he lived there.  The officers had a search warrant for the home, but did not 
have an identified suspect.  Mr. Irving was charged with Possession with Intent to 
Distribute Marijuana and Cocaine.  He spent one and a half months in jail until he 
was released on bond.  A motion to suppress hearing was held regarding the 
criminal charges.  The motion was allowed and the case was dismissed  
 
The ACRB investigation revealed that the court ruled that the search 
conducted by members of the Atlanta Police Department was not proper. 
Interviews with the officers involved in this arrest revealed that they found a 
backpack in the kitchen and it belonged to Mr. Irving.  They also said that he had a 
key in his possession which opened the burglar bars that were located at the front 
door of the house in question.  Mr. Irving had a pink pill in his pocket which was 
the same as some prescription medicine that was found inside the house.  All of 
the officers claimed that they had no knowledge of Irving prior to the execution of 
the search warrant. 
 
Please continue… 
 
 
Chief George Turner

The Board concluded that this arrest was made in violation of the Fourth 
Amendment.  The evidence indicated that Detective Silberman may have had 
reasonable suspicion to stop and detain Mr. Irving; however, he lacked probable 
cause to arrest.  The mere fact that Mr. Irving was sitting on the porch did not 
give Detective Silberman probable cause to search and arrest him.  
 
For these reasons, the ACRB voted unanimously to sustain the allegation 
of False Arrest against Detective Andrew Silberman.  The Board voted to 
recommend that you impose a one day suspension on the officer.  This 
recommendation is consistent with Atlanta Police Department disciplinary 
guidelines. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would 
like to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires the Chief to 
respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or 
will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission 
of a recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Joy Morrissey 
Board Chair

A letter dated September\n17, 2010 was forwarded to you advising the Atlanta Police Department had commenced its\n‘own investigation and upon its completion, I would inform the Citizen Review Board of my\ndecision on its recommendation.\n\nBased upon its investigation, the Atlanta Police Department's Office of Professional\n‘Standards has concluded that Investigator Silberman should be Exonerated ofthe charge of\nappropriate action required. Through a review of Investigator Silberman’s investigative file\nand the Fulton County Suppression Hearing transcript, it was determined thatthe investigator\nacted appropriately; following all procedures and policies ofthe Department in his\ninvestigation and inthe search warrant execution at 855 Coleman Street. The judge at the\nhearing suppressed the evidence of the key found in Mr. Irving's pocket subsequent to his\narrest after consideration of case law in detaining a person on the front porch of a location\n‘where a search warrant isto be executed. Evidence found inside the house as a result of the\nsearch warrant, including Mr. Irving's black book bag, were kept as evidence for further\nprosecution ofthe charges.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, the Office of Professional Standards also spoke\nwith the Assistant District Attomey, Blair Shores, who argued against the suppression of\nevidence in the arrest of Mr. Irving. He informed the Office of Professional Standards that\n“Without this evidence, we felt there was not enough of a nexus between the defendant and\nthe drugs inthe home. ‘So, we placed the case on the dead docket.” The case was not\n\n"", ""Ms. Joy Morrissey, Board Chair\n‘Complaint #10-07/ Domice Irving\nDecember 13, 2010\n\nPage 2\n\ndismissed by the court. And, even ifa case is dismissed or dead docketed, that does not\nconclude the aresting officer did not have sufficient probable cause to make the arrest. In this\n«ase, there was physical evidence that linked Mr. Irving to the house searched and contraband\nide. Case law supports that an officer can detain a person on or around premises during the\n‘execution ofa search warrant (Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692 [1981]), particularly for\nthe purpose of officer safety (0.C.G.A. 17-5-28). Not only did the team have to contain a\nperson on the porch, atthe front door of a home where they were about to execute a search\n‘warrant, but they also had to sufficiently establish after the search his connection to the\nlocation and the black book bag, along with the narcotics found inside. ADA Shores further\nstated to the Office of Professional Standards, “As to whether an [sic] evidence found could be\nused in a criminal ease, the case law is mixed and we lost this motion. However, the detention\nis necessary and proper.” ADA Shores also expressed to the Office of Professional Standards\nthatthe Atianta Citizen Review Board only contacted Mr. Irving's defense attomney for her\ninput on the case and never spoke with him or, as far as he knows, reviewed the court\n‘transcript, “the only neutral source of information in this case.” The District Attorney's office\ncould decide ata later date to go forward with the case against Mr. Irving using evidence\nobtained from Investigator Silberman’s search warrant and that evidence could be used to\nprosecute others later arrested as a result ofthat search.\n\nIt should be noted that Mr. Irving had a probation violation warrant on him at the time\nof his arrest by Investigator Silberman and possibly perjured himself about being on probation\n<during the suppression hearing for pleading guilty on firearms and drug charges in 2006.\n\nHaving assessed the findings of both the Atlanta Citizen Review Board and the\nDepartment's investigative summaries, I reject the recommendation of the Citizen Review\n‘Board that the false arrest allegation against Investigator Silberman be Sustained.\n\nMajor E.

RE:  #10-17 Complaint of Trenton Boyd 
 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“the ACRB”) completed its 
investigation and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Trenton Boyd 
alleging that Officers Pettis and Guevara of the RED DOG unit engaged in 
unnecessary and excessive force by repeatedly striking and kicking him in the 
head and chest when he was arrested on January 29, 2010.   
 
Mr. Boyd said that he was a passenger in a car driven by his friend, Robert 
Burr, and the police tried to stop the car.  Mr. Burr initially stopped and when the 
officers approached the driver’s window, Officer Guevara began to yell and 
threatened to break the window and Burr abruptly sped off.  The police chased 
them and Burr stopped the car at an apartment complex and Boyd and Burr ran.  
The police chased them and drew their weapons and ordered them to stop and get 
on the ground.  Mr. Boyd alleges that they both complied.  More police cars 
arrived and an unidentified officer handcuffed him.  He alleges that Officer Pettis 
and two other officers began to punch and kick him in his face and chest.  He 
claims that both he and Mr. Burr were repeatedly struck and kicked.  Mr. Boyd 
says that he was then dragged down a hill where he was evaluated by the fire 
department.  He complained of pain and chest pains so they called an ambulance.  
He was transported to Grady Hospital and medical records reveal that he 
sustained bruises and two fractures to his face, as well as, bruises to his chest and 
buttocks.  The medical record and photographs are part of the investigative 
record. Mr. Boyd was charged with two counts of obstruction and trying to 
remove a weapon from a public official.  While he claims that the charges were 
unfounded, he took a plea deal to avoid having a felony conviction on his record.  
He is currently a college student.

Mr. Burr was interviewed and said that when he was stopped, he 
lowered his window and the officers began yelling and he became frightened 
and sped off.  When they got into an area with other people, he stopped and ran 
into the woods.  He said that when the officers caught up with them, they were 
ordered to get on the ground.  He complied but Boyd stood frozen with his 
hands up.  Burr said that two officers began beating Boyd and kicked him in the 
chest and he could hear Boyd complaining.  He said they were both dragged 
down the hill to the police wagon.  Mr. Burr said that Boyd did not resist or 
strike any of the officers.   
 
Gary Davis, a resident in the area, stated that he observed some police 
activity on the day of the arrest.  He said that the situation had ended by the 
time he came outside; however, he did see the police dragging an individual 
down the hill.   
 
Four officers who were at the scene were interviewed: Sergeant Taylor, 
Officer Mayes, Officer Guevara and Officer Pettis.  Sgt. Taylor did not see the 
force that was applied; however, he said that Officer Pettis told him he had to 
use force because Boyd tried to take his gun or OC spray.  Officer Guevara said 
that he and Officer Pettis were involved in the foot chase and when they caught 
up to Mr. Burr and Mr. Boyd, he ordered them to get on the ground.  Officer 
Guevara handcuffed Mr. Burr and Officer Pettis tried to control Mr. Boyd.  He 
observed Boyd grab Officer Pettis’ duty belt but did not see any physical force 
exchanged because he was busy with Mr. Burr.  
 
Officer Pettis said that when Mr. Burr and Boyd were stopped, they 
dropped to their knees but continued to rise up.  He repeatedly ordered them to 
get down on the ground and when Officer Pettis approached Mr. Boyd, Boyd 
got up and started to run.  He grabbed his shirt and pulled him and Boyd 
resisted.  He used a leg sweep to bring Boyd to the ground and then straddled 
his waist and told him to put his hands behind his back.  Boyd refused and 
continued to resist and reached for his neck.  Boyd then reached for his duty 
belt in an attempt to take his gun and OC Spray.  Boyd swung a fist to Officer 
Pettis’ face, and Pettis punched him and hit him in the head.  They continued to 
struggle for a few more seconds and he managed to get one handcuff on Mr. 
Boyd.  Officer Mayes arrived and assisted. 
 
Officer Pettis admitted to striking Mr. Boyd but contends that the force 
was justified because Boyd resisted arrest by fighting and attempting to grab his 
weapon and OC Spray.  Boyd pleaded guilty to the associated charges.  None of 
the other witnesses or officers could verify either of the versions of the incident.

The Board carefully considered the evidence in this case and voiced 
considerable concern about the nature of the injuries that were sustained by the 
complainant, including two fractures and significant bruising to his face.  
However, because there was no confirmation of either version of the events, the 
Board voted unanimously to Not Sustain the allegation of excessive force 
against Officer Pettis and Guevara. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you 
would like to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires the 
Chief to respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, 
rejected, or will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of 
the submission of a recommendation for action of the Board to the Chief.

It cannot be\nproven fiom the contradictory statements of the officers and the complainant that\nunnecessary or excessive force was used inthe arrest. Mr. Boyd stated he complied with\nOfficer Pets’ orders after a short vehicle and foot pursuit; and was assaulted by the officer,\nconcluding with Officer Pets allegedly kicking him in the chest. Officer Petts stated he was\n‘met with violent resistance by Mr. Boyd when he attempted to handcuff him; including,\nbeing punched and Mr. Boyd grabbing at his weapon and O.C. spray. Officer Petts stated he\n‘only used comparable physical force to stop Mr. Boyd’s resistance and the potential bodily\n‘harm to him and Officer Guevara. He stated he never kicked Mr. Boyd during the physical\nstruggle. Officer Guevara stated that while Officer Pettis was struggling with Mr. Boyd, he\n‘was engaged with the driver, Mr. Robert Bur, who was also resisting being handcuffed. He\nstated he never kicked or struck Mr. Boyd during the males"" arrest.\n\nIn addition to the complaint of excessive force during his arrest on January 29, 2010,\nMr. Boyd complained that during a police encounter in front of Chanterelle’s Restaurant on.\n\n', 'Ms. Joy Morrissey, Board Chair\nComplaints #10-17 and #10-24/Trenton Boyd\nDecember 13, 2010\n\nPage 2\n\nMarch 20, 2010, he was strip-searched and harassed by Officer Guevara, Inthe letter dated\n‘October 18, 2010, the Atlanta Citizen Review Board recommended that Officer Guevara be\n‘Sustained for false imprisonment of Mr. Boyd during that encounter. The Board found that\nthe stop was illegal and substantiated by two (2) witnesses; and the officer\'s assertion that he\ncould not recall ifthe stop was not credible. Additionally, the Board found the stop of Mr.\nBoyd was not properly documented as required by standard operating procedure.\n\n‘As a result ofits investigation, the Atlanta Police Department\'s Office of Professional\n‘Standards has concluded from its investigation that the allegation against Officer Guevara be\nNot Sustained for appropriate action required. It cannot be proven that Officer Guevara\nperformed an improper search of Mr. Boyd based merely on his previous encounter with the\n‘complainant, which occurred on January 29"". It is not clear why Officer Guevara and his\n{teammates did not recall encountering Mr. Boyd in front of the restaurant when asked by\ninvestigators; however, an unbiased witness did state in both the Board\'s and the\nDepartment\'s investigations that she did witness a Hispanic male officer speaking with Mr,\nBoyd, but did not see the officer searching the male.\n\nAAs for te officers not pulling out with radio at the location or documenting it on their\nsctvity shee, it cannot be substantiated that this was afield interview of Mr. Boyd and\nshould have conformed to requirements under APD.SOP.3065. Officer Guevara is a member\nof the Red Dog Unit that typically patrols ina team structure and therefore, can make\n‘numerous potice-itzen encounters during ther tour of duty. On a daly bass, officers stop\nand converse with citizens; encounters that do not rise tothe level of field interviews that\n‘require pulling out with radio and documenting. In tis case with Officer Guevara, the stop\n‘may have been a bref stop when itis considered: (1) Mr. Boyd\'s statement that hs fiend,\n‘who was driving that day, almost collided with the officers’ vehicle drawing the initial\nsuspicion fora stop and (2) a witness who did not see Mr. Boyd being searched by Officer\nGuevara or any other Atlanta police officer.\n\nHaving assessed the findings ofboth the Atlanta Citizen Review Board and the\nDepartment’ investigative summaries, [accept the recommendation ofthe Citizen Review\nBoard thatthe allegation that Officer Guevara and Officer Petts used excessive force during\nthe January 29, 2010 aest of Trenton Boyd be Not Sustained. {furthermore reject the\nrecommendation of the Citizen Review Board thatthe allegation that Officer Guevara falsely\nimprisoned Mr. Boyd on March 20,2010 and failed to properly document this March 20,\n2010 stop be Sustained.\n\nMajor E. B.

RE: #10-19 Complaint of Ransford Asamoah 
 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation 
and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Ransford Asamoah against 
Officer Sammie Hayslett.  Mr. Asamoah alleged that Officer Hayslett falsely 
imprisoned him and used excessive force. 
 
Mr. Asamoah complained that on March 9, 2010, as he was walking on 
Peachtree Street with Anthony Chavarria at approximately 4 p.m., he was 
approached by several men who attempted to sell him marijuana.  He said he 
tried to get away by stopping into a store located at 65 Peachtree Street.  While in 
the store, he was approached by Officer Hayslett.  Officer Hayslett searched him 
and Mr. Asamoah claims that he cooperated.  The officer then told him he was 
under arrest and tried to handcuff him.  Mr. Asamoah said that he knew the 
officer did not have any legal reason to arrest him, so he began to walk away.  He 
claims that the officer hit him in the face approximately three times.  He claims 
that he never hit the officer and that he managed to get away and walked towards 
the Marta station.  As Asamoah walked, an unidentified male civilian approached 
him and punched him the face.  Officer Hayslett was walking behind the civilian.  
An unidentified Caucasian officer in a patrol car approached and told him he was 
under arrest.  He was taken to the police precinct where he remained for four and 
a half hours bleeding from his finger and nose as a result of the altercation with 
the officer.  He was taken to Grady Hospital and remained overnight and was 
then taken to jail.  He was charged with battery and felony obstruction.  The 
charges were “dead docketed” on August 5, 2010.   
 
Mr. Anthony Chavarria stated that he and Asamoah were walking on 
Peachtree Street when Officer Hayslett approached and accused them of buying 
marijuana and searched each of them by patting their clothing and going in their

pockets; nothing was found.  After the officer searched each of them, Asamoah 
told Officer Hayslett that he had done nothing wrong and he had no right to 
search him and Asamoah tried to walk away.  The officer pulled him back and 
Asamoah tried to walk away again. The officer punched him in the face several 
times.  Chavarria claims that Asamoah never resisted; he only put his hands up to 
protect his face.  They managed to get away from the officer and walked down 
the street and the officer handcuffed Chavarria to his hand and began to pursue 
Asamoah.  An unidentified civilian approached the officer and asked if he wanted 
help and the civilian chased Asamoah and began punching him in the face several 
times.  Asamoah managed to get away and Mr. Chavarria lost sight of him.  Mr. 
Chavarria was taken to the precinct but was not charged.   
 
Mr. Asamoah claimed that the store where this occurred has surveillance 
cameras.  However, a check with the owner of J & J Gold Teeth, Ms. Courtenay 
Nguyen, revealed that there are no surveillance cameras.  Ms. Nguyen said that 
she recalled the incident, but she did not pay much attention and could not 
provide relevant information.   
 
The police reports, including the Use of Force Report, indicated that, “Mr. 
Asamoah pushed Officer Hayslett in the chest and swung a punch at him.  Officer 
Hayslett defended himself by punching Mr. Asamoah in the face and body 
multiple times in his attempts to arrest Asamoah.” 
   
Officer Hayslett was interviewed and stated that he observed Asamoah 
and another man talking to known drug dealers in the area of 82 Peachtree Street.  
They appeared to be engaged in a drug transaction.  He explained that Asamoah 
and the known drug dealers went downstairs and he followed them and called out 
to them, but they ignored him.  The men and Asamoah separated and Asamoah 
and his friend went upstairs and the known drug dealers walked towards the 
Martin Luther King side exit.  He stopped Asamoah and Chavarria and Asamoah 
immediately got hostile and told him that he had no reason to stop him.  Hayslett 
tried to calm Asamoah down and explained the reason for the stop.  He decided to 
detain Mr. Asamoah and handcuff him.  He said that Asamoah jumped back, got 
into a defensive position and appeared ready to punch him.  Mr. Asamoah’s hands 
were up and the officer punched him in the face twice.  He noted that Mr. 
Asamoah was bleeding from his nose.  He tried to grab Mr. Asamoah and they 
struggled.  Asamoah got away from him and ran.  Officers saw him and they 
apprehended Asamoah and brought him back to the precinct.  They provided 
medical assistance and transported him to Grady Hospital where he was evaluated 
and treated.

The officer’s version of the incident with regard to the allegation of 
excessive force contradicts the statement of Mr. Asamoah.  There were no 
independent witnesses and thus, the ACRB unanimously voted to assign a finding 
of Not Sustained to the allegation of excessive force.  The Board further voted to 
assign a finding of Unfounded to the allegation of unlawful imprisonment.  
Officer Hayslett observed what appeared to be a drug transaction and was 
justified in detaining Mr. Asamoah. 
   
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would 
like to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires the Chief to 
respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or 
will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission 
of a recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.  See Sec. 2-2211(O).

RE:  Complaint #10-20 / Tony Smith 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“the ACRB”) completed its investigation and 
adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Tony Smith against Investigator Charles 
Brown.   
 
Mr. Smith alleged that Investigator Charles Brown used excessive force when he 
arrested him at Grady High School on October 7, 2009.  Mr. Smith was a juvenile at 
the time of his arrest for unarmed robbery.  Mr. Smith and Sanquavious Anderson were 
arrested by Investigators Brown and Larry Bennett at about 8:30 a.m.  They were taken 
to the office of the Assistant Principal.  He claimed that during his detention he 
complained to the officers that his handcuffs were too tight.  According to Mr. Smith, 
Investigator Brown ignored his complaint that his handcuffs were on too tight.  He said 
that Investigator Bennett loosened the handcuffs but Mr. Smith produced photographs 
that show red indentations to his wrists.  The photograph that was taken with his cell 
phone shows him handcuffed to the filing cabinet.  He further stated that he was held 
handcuffed in the schools in various locations until about 3:15 p.m. before being 
transported to a juvenile detention facility. 
 
Investigator Bennett was interviewed and he explained that when Mr. Smith 
complained about the tight handcuffs, he (Bennett) loosened them.  He never witnessed 
Investigator Brown purposely tighten the handcuffs.   
 
Investigator Brown was interviewed and he denied purposely tightening Mr. Smith’s 
handcuffs.  He further denied that Mr. Smith was handcuffed to the file cabinet.  He 
explained that Mr. Smith was always within eye sight of himself or Investigator 
Bennett.   
 
Mr. Sanquavious Anderson was interviewed and said that he and Mr. Smith were 
arrested together.  He observed Mr. Smith handcuffed to a file cabinet in a room near 
the Assistant Principal’s office.  They were separated but he could hear and speak 
freely with Mr. Smith throughout their detention in the school.  He said that Mr. Smith 
complained about the handcuffs being on too tightly just prior to their transport to 
Juvenile Detention.  He said that Investigator Bennett loosened Mr. Smith’s handcuffs.

August 16, 2010 
Page 2 of 2 
 
 
 
Assistant Principal Roosevelt Foreman said that he never witnessed Mr. Smith 
complain to the officers that the handcuffs were too tight.  He said that the young men 
were laughing and joking.   
 
While the photographs show injury to Mr. Smith’s wrist, this is not conclusive that 
there was excessive force, particularly since 2 witnesses claim that when Mr. Smith 
complained that the cuffs were too tight, Investigator Bennett loosened the.  For this 
reason, the Board voted to recommend that this allegation be assigned the finding of 
not sustained.  However, the Board was concerned that there were some policy 
violations that may have contributed to this complaint.   
 
The Atlanta Police Department SOP 3190 addresses juvenile procedures.  It requires 
officers to bring the juvenile to the appropriate juvenile detention facility within a 
reasonable amount of time (unless the juvenile is in need of emergency medical 
treatment).  These juveniles were held for at least seven hours before being transported 
by a prisoner transport wagon.  There was no explanation for this delay.  Atlanta Police 
Department SOP 3030 requires the arresting officers to transport juvenile prisoners.  
This was not performed.  The third apparent violation was the manner of handcuffing.  
Atlanta Police Department SOP 3030 states that, “when no other suitable method of 
detention is available, detainees may be secured to an immovable object that is 
designed for such use.”  Clearly, a filing cabinet is not designed to be used to handcuff 
detainees and this may have contributed to the complainant’s injuries. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would like to have 
a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires the Chief to respond in writing 
regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be implemented with 
modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation for action 
by the Board to the Chief.  See Sec. 2-2211(O).

RE:  #10-24 Complaint of Trenton Boyd 
 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation and 
adjudication of Trenton Boyd’s complaint alleging that Officer Guevara falsely 
imprisoned him and searched him without legal justification on March 20, 2010.  Mr. 
Boyd filed a previous complaint alleging excessive force against Officer Guevara on 
March 18, 2010.   
 
Mr. Boyd said that he was a passenger in a car driven by his friend, Emmanuel 
Hall, and his friend almost collided with a marked Atlanta Police vehicle that contained 
four Red Dog officers.  The driver swerved to avoid the accident and then parked the car 
and started to walk towards Chanterelle's Cafe at 646 Evans Street in order to eat dinner.  
He saw a patrol car coming towards them and he realized that Officer Guevara was in 
the patrol car.  The patrol car stopped abruptly and Officer Guevara exited the car and 
ran towards him and stopped him and began to search him by pulling down his pants and 
underwear.   Mr. Boyd told the officer that he had no right to search him and that he had 
filed a complaint.  He said another, African American officer assisted Officer Guevara 
with the search.  The assisting officer told him to calm down and asked why his heart 
was beating so fast and he told the officer that he had two open heart surgeries.  Officer 
Guevara told the other officer that he knew about this.  Mr. Boyd said that the officers 
asked his friend for identification and told him to watch where he was going.  Mr. 
Boyd’s friend, Emmanuel Hall, confirmed this version of the incident and added that 
another police vehicle drove up to the stop.  The manager of the restaurant observed Mr. 
Boyd being confronted by two Atlanta Police officers whom, she was only able to 
identify as being Hispanic and African American.   
 
Officer Guevara was assigned to a car on the day in question, along with Officers 
Perry, Chao and Jefferson.  However, the report indicates that Officer Jefferson was off 
on that day.  They were assigned to Zone 4, which is where the stop occurred.   
 
 
Continue please… 
 
 
 
Chief George Turner 
RE:  #10-24 Complaint of Trenton Boyd 
October 18, 2010 
Page 2 
 
 
 
Officer Chao indicated that he did not recall participating in or being present at 
the alleged stop of Mr. Boyd and was not familiar with Mr. Boyd or Chanterelle's Cafe.  
Officer Perry could not recall the stop.  They each indicated that they were supposed to 
notify the dispatcher when conducting stops and annotate the stop on their daily activity 
sheets.   
 
Officer Guevara stated that he did not recall an encounter with Mr. Boyd on that 
day.  He recalled the incident on January 29th.  He said that they are required to notify 
dispatch and document the stop; however, he admitted that it was not always the practice.  
He also said that sometimes a team of three officers would have another officer join them 
during their tour of duty. 
 
The Board voted unanimously that the allegation of false imprisonment be 
sustained because, in addition to the complainant, two other witnesses (Emmanuel Hall 
and Jean Bridges), observed the stop.  The officers’ assertion that they could not recall 
the stop is not credible.  The stop was unlawful and not properly documented as required 
by the Standard Operating Procedure.   
 
The Board further considered the appropriate discipline.  The violation was 
assigned a Category B designation, pursuant to the Atlanta Police Department’s Standard 
Operating Procedure.  They voted unanimously to recommend that you impose a three 
(3) day suspension of this violation which falls within the guidelines that exist in your 
disciplinary procedures.  
  
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to have a copy of the 
full investigation.  The ordinance requires the Chief to respond in writing regarding 
which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be implemented with 
modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a recommendation for action 
by the Board to the Chief.

It is not clear why Officer Guevara and his\n{teammates did not recall encountering Mr. Boyd in front of the restaurant when asked by\ninvestigators; however, an unbiased witness did state in both the Board\'s and the\nDepartment\'s investigations that she did witness a Hispanic male officer speaking with Mr,\nBoyd, but did not see the officer searching the male.\n\nAAs for te officers not pulling out with radio at the location or documenting it on their\nsctvity shee, it cannot be substantiated that this was afield interview of Mr. Boyd and\nshould have conformed to requirements under APD.SOP.3065.

More specifically, she said that on the day prior to the\nincident, she and her nephew had a disagreement and her nephew struck her in\nthe mouth. She called 911 and an officer responded. She explained to the officer\nthat she wanted her nephew removed from her home and said that the officer told\nher that someone from Metro would come by the following day to take her\nnephew. The next day, she heard banging at her door and when she opened the\ndoor, the same officer and EMS personnel were there. She claims that she did\n‘not know why the police were at the door. Ms, Martin said that the officer\nforcibly pushed the door open and this caused her to be thrown to the floor. The\nofficer entered, handcuffed her and dragged her out of the apartment into an\nambulance. She was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\n‘The Incident Report produced by Officer Gaither stated that he was\ndispatched to Ms. Martin\'s home as a result of a 911 call involving an unruly\nchild. ‘The officer said that Ms. Martin became volatite and it was clear to him\nthat she suffered from a mental disorder and she appeared to be a danger to\nherself or others.\n\n‘The 911 call tapes reflect that a call was made to 911 at 7:46.a.m. and the\nwoman caller said that she wanted a 16 year old child removed from her home\nbecause he was being unruly.

When he arrived, Officer Gaither and Schifauer were present and he\n‘observed that Ms. Martin appeared to be suffering from some type of mental\nillness and was transported to Grady Hospital.\n\nOfficer Schiffbauer stated that he responded because Officer Gaither\n‘needed assistance with a demented person.

He notified his supervisor and requested EMS so that\nshe could be taken to the hospital for evaluation. He reported that Ms. Marti\n\nclosed the door and he asked her to open it and she complied. He placed his hand\n‘on the door to keep it open and asked the nephew to come outside. He said that\nMs. Martin became agitated, grabbed a chair as if she was going to throw it at\nthem and went back into the kitchen area. That is when he and Officer\nSchiffbauer decided to handcuff her. As the officers were approaching her, Ms,\nMartin grabbed the wall and dropped to the floor.

However, asa result of its investigation, OPS did determine that there is\nsufficient evidence to Sustain the allegation of Conformance to Directives (APD.SOP.3020,\n“Search and Seizure,” Section 4.3.3) against Investigator Kirkman. In order to have seized Mr.\nKaut2's cell phone, Investigator Kirkman’s actions should have been supported by reasonable\nsuspicion that criminal activity was afoot involving Mr. Kautz.

The specific rules are quoted and listed in the accompanying report and appear\nbelow in the form of a char. Additionally, the Board noted that it was evident, during the\n‘course ofthe interviews with many’of the officers, that they were unfamiliar with constitutional\nrequirements for conducting searches and seizures. Some officers genuinely believed that itis\nproper to place all of the patrons on the floor and isk them because of officer safety\n‘consideration.

Further, there was never any evidence that say of\nthe patrons were armed on this night or on any of the other occasions that the officers visited\nthe Eagle Ba.\n\nDaring the interview conducted with Sergeant Collier, it became clear that he could not\n‘remember important details concerning what occurred on the night of the raid. He explained\nthat he was assigned to observe the bar area, however, he coukd not say how many bartenders\n‘were working. He replied that there were two or three or four bartenders working. He said he\nid not provide direction to any officers and that he just stood atthe bar. When asked if he\n‘went up stairs with Investigator Bridges and Sergeant Adams to arrest Mr. Shepherd, he said\nthat he did go and he could not remember ifthe officers knocked at the door and could not\nremember how and when the door was opened. He could not remember how many times he\n‘observed criminal behavior and he didnot do anything to establish the identity of the persons\n‘who committed criminal violations, He could not say how long the patrons were kept on the\nfloor and he didnot remember the instructions given tothe officers at the briefing that preceded\nthe entry into the Eagle Bar.

RE: Complaint #10-71, Allan King 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation 
and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Allan Kind alleging false 
imprisonment by Officers Jonathan Davis, Eric Wheeler, and Ronald Stoddard.  
The allegations were investigated by Sheena Robertson based on a timely 
complaint filed by Mr. King.  
 
Mr. King alleges that on December 2, 2010, at about 7:45 p.m., the above 
named officers stopped and detained him without legal justification as he walked 
through the parking lot of the Lenox Mall.  He explained that he was walking to 
the Apple Store located in the mall and three police officers in a Quality of Life 
Van approached him.  The officer seated in the front passenger side asked him if 
he was stealing cars and he replied that he did not know anything about cars being 
stolen in the lot.  He said he told the officers that he had just walked onto the lot 
from a nearby crosswalk.  The three officers got out of the van and approached 
him.  The driver asked him whether he was going to the mall and Mr. King told 
the officer he was going to the Apple Store.  The officer told him that Georgia 
Law prohibits anyone from walking on a parking lot if the person does not have a 
car on the lot.  The officer seated in the back of the van asked for identification, 
which he surrendered.  They checked his identification and everything came back 
okay and the officer told him to leave.  He claims to have been detained for 10-15 
minutes.   
 
The officers were identified by contacting the Zone 2 Commander who 
explained that the officers in the Quality of Life Van were performing Hot Spot 
overtime during the holidays.  Officers Wheeler, Davis and Stoddard were 
assigned to the Lenox Mall because of a reportedly large number of pedestrian 
robberies and car break-ins.

At roll call, he was advised by Sergeants Bender and Harty not to allow anyone to walk 
through the parking lot if the person did not have a vehicle parked therein.  Officer 
Davis observed Allan King walking through the lot, so they stopped him and asked for 
his name.  Mr. King did not respond so they asked him again.  Officer Davis said he 
then exited the van and asked Mr. King how he was doing and at that point, Mr. King 
put his hands behind his back.  Officer Davis thought he may be reaching for something 
so he issued him a command to show his hands.  Officers Wheeler and Stoddard exited 
the van.  Officer Davis then observed two other pedestrians walking in the parking lot, 
so he went over to deal with them.  Officer Wheeler asked Mr. King for his 
identification, but was unaware whether the identification was checked on ACIC.  
Officer Davis said they returned Mr. King’s identification and explained to him that he 
could not walk through the parking lot if he did not have a car parked on it.  Officer 
Davis said that Mr. Allan told him that he was on the way to work.  Officer Davis said 
that they did not pull out of service or notify the dispatcher before stopping Mr. King. 
 
Officer Eric Wheeler advised that on December 2, 2010, he, along with Officers 
Stoddard and Davis were patrolling the Lenox Square Mall Parking Lot and they 
observed Mr. King.  Wheeler was asked why they stopped Mr. King and he began to 
read his written statement that he had provided to OPS.  He explained they saw Mr. 
King positioned between two cars and it appeared that he was looking into the window 
of one of the cars.  He did not have keys in his possession so he pointed that out to 
Officer Davis.  They drove up to Mr. King and asked him what he was doing, but Mr. 
King did not respond.  He repeated the question, but Mr. King did not respond.  Officer 
Wheeler said Mr. King put his hands behind him and they immediately commanded 
him to show his hands but he did not comply.  Officer Wheeler asked for his 
identification and checked him through ACIC and it came back okay and they let him 
go.  He said that their supervisor told them to challenge any suspicious persons in the 
parking lot in Lenox Mall because there had been vehicle break-ins.  He said that he did 
not think that they called out with the pedestrian stop as required by Standard Operating 
Procedure.   
 
Officer Ronald Stoddard explained that Mr. King was stopped after they 
observed him walking between cars possibly looking through car windows.  He did not 
have any keys in his hands and it did not appear that he had a car in the lot.  He 
explained that the van drove up to Mr. King and they asked him where he was going.  
Mr. King stopped but he did not respond; instead, he put both hands behind his back.  
Officer Stoddard became alarmed so they all quickly exited the vehicle.  They 
commanded Mr. King to show his hands.  They asked for identification and said that 
Officer Wheeler explained that they were stopping him because there had been 
numerous break-ins.  They told him that in the future, he should walk around the 
parking lots instead of walking through them.  They did not frisk or cuff Mr. King, nor 
did they put their hands on him at any time during the encounter.

A check of the police radio transmissions and the vehicle’s Mobile Data 
Transmissions was performed and no record was found of an inquiry for Mr. King.  The 
Board noted that the officers did not follow the procedure concerning stops of 
suspicious persons (S.O.P. 3065, Section 4.1.1).   
 
The Board considered the evidence and voted to sustain the allegation of 
Unlawful Imprisonment.  The Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement officers to 
briefly detain individuals for investigatory purposes if the officers reasonably suspect 
that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.  
Furthermore, the US Supreme Court has adopted a dual inquiry for evaluating the 
reasonableness of an investigative stop, to wit, “whether the officer’s action was 
justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the 
circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.”  Mr. King was stopped 
for walking in the Lenox Square Mall parking lot.  One of the officers said that Mr. 
King might have been looking in car windows.  He also had no car keys.  This is not 
reasonable suspicion.   
 
The Board discussed some of the factual issues that arose as a result of the 
investigation.  These three officers were all new officers.  There was no senior officer 
assigned to this patrol team.  Also, the officers failed to inform the dispatcher about the 
stop.  This is a violation of policy.  Also, they were concerned that officers are no 
properly trained on the requirements of imposed by the Fourth Amendment when 
conducting stops.  The Board was of the opinion that the Department could benefit 
from more training regarding articulable suspicion, probable cause and when there is 
insufficient evidence to support a constitutional seizure.  For these reasons, the Board 
voted to recommend that you issue a written reprimand to the three officers and provide 
Department-wide training to help officers better understand Fourth Amendment law.  
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would like 
to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires that the Chief respond 
in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.  See Sec. 2-2211(O) of 
Ordinance 07-0-0141.

RE: Complaint #10-71, Allan King 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation 
and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Allan Kind alleging false 
imprisonment by Officers Jonathan Davis, Eric Wheeler, and Ronald Stoddard.  
The allegations were investigated by Sheena Robertson based on a timely 
complaint filed by Mr. King.  
 
Mr. King alleges that on December 2, 2010, at about 7:45 p.m., the above 
named officers stopped and detained him without legal justification as he walked 
through the parking lot of the Lenox Mall.  He explained that he was walking to 
the Apple Store located in the mall and three police officers in a Quality of Life 
Van approached him.  The officer seated in the front passenger side asked him if 
he was stealing cars and he replied that he did not know anything about cars being 
stolen in the lot.  He said he told the officers that he had just walked onto the lot 
from a nearby crosswalk.  The three officers got out of the van and approached 
him.  The driver asked him whether he was going to the mall and Mr. King told 
the officer he was going to the Apple Store.  The officer told him that Georgia 
Law prohibits anyone from walking on a parking lot if the person does not have a 
car on the lot.  The officer seated in the back of the van asked for identification, 
which he surrendered.  They checked his identification and everything came back 
okay and the officer told him to leave.  He claims to have been detained for 10-15 
minutes.   
 
The officers were identified by contacting the Zone 2 Commander who 
explained that the officers in the Quality of Life Van were performing Hot Spot 
overtime during the holidays.  Officers Wheeler, Davis and Stoddard were 
assigned to the Lenox Mall because of a reportedly large number of pedestrian 
robberies and car break-ins.

RE: Complaint #10-71, Allan King 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation 
and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Allan Kind alleging false 
imprisonment by Officers Jonathan Davis, Eric Wheeler, and Ronald Stoddard.  
The allegations were investigated by Sheena Robertson based on a timely 
complaint filed by Mr. King.  
 
Mr. King alleges that on December 2, 2010, at about 7:45 p.m., the above 
named officers stopped and detained him without legal justification as he walked 
through the parking lot of the Lenox Mall.  He explained that he was walking to 
the Apple Store located in the mall and three police officers in a Quality of Life 
Van approached him.  The officer seated in the front passenger side asked him if 
he was stealing cars and he replied that he did not know anything about cars being 
stolen in the lot.  He said he told the officers that he had just walked onto the lot 
from a nearby crosswalk.  The three officers got out of the van and approached 
him.  The driver asked him whether he was going to the mall and Mr. King told 
the officer he was going to the Apple Store.  The officer told him that Georgia 
Law prohibits anyone from walking on a parking lot if the person does not have a 
car on the lot.  The officer seated in the back of the van asked for identification, 
which he surrendered.  They checked his identification and everything came back 
okay and the officer told him to leave.  He claims to have been detained for 10-15 
minutes.   
 
The officers were identified by contacting the Zone 2 Commander who 
explained that the officers in the Quality of Life Van were performing Hot Spot 
overtime during the holidays.  Officers Wheeler, Davis and Stoddard were 
assigned to the Lenox Mall because of a reportedly large number of pedestrian 
robberies and car break-ins.

Officer Jonathan Davis said that on December 2, 2010, he, along with Officers 
Wheeler and Stoddard were assigned to patrol the parking lot of Lenox Square Mall.  
At roll call, he was advised by Sergeants Bender and Harty not to allow anyone to walk 
through the parking lot if the person did not have a vehicle parked therein.  Officer 
Davis observed Allan King walking through the lot, so they stopped him and asked for 
his name.  Mr. King did not respond so they asked him again.  Officer Davis said he 
then exited the van and asked Mr. King how he was doing and at that point, Mr. King 
put his hands behind his back.  Officer Davis thought he may be reaching for something 
so he issued him a command to show his hands.  Officers Wheeler and Stoddard exited 
the van.  Officer Davis then observed two other pedestrians walking in the parking lot, 
so he went over to deal with them.  Officer Wheeler asked Mr. King for his 
identification, but was unaware whether the identification was checked on ACIC.  
Officer Davis said they returned Mr. King’s identification and explained to him that he 
could not walk through the parking lot if he did not have a car parked on it.  Officer 
Davis said that Mr. Allan told him that he was on the way to work.  Officer Davis said 
that they did not pull out of service or notify the dispatcher before stopping Mr. King. 
 
Officer Eric Wheeler advised that on December 2, 2010, he, along with Officers 
Stoddard and Davis were patrolling the Lenox Square Mall Parking Lot and they 
observed Mr. King.  Wheeler was asked why they stopped Mr. King and he began to 
read his written statement that he had provided to OPS.  He explained they saw Mr. 
King positioned between two cars and it appeared that he was looking into the window 
of one of the cars.  He did not have keys in his possession so he pointed that out to 
Officer Davis.  They drove up to Mr. King and asked him what he was doing, but Mr. 
King did not respond.  He repeated the question, but Mr. King did not respond.  Officer 
Wheeler said Mr. King put his hands behind him and they immediately commanded 
him to show his hands but he did not comply.  Officer Wheeler asked for his 
identification and checked him through ACIC and it came back okay and they let him 
go.  He said that their supervisor told them to challenge any suspicious persons in the 
parking lot in Lenox Mall because there had been vehicle break-ins.  He said that he did 
not think that they called out with the pedestrian stop as required by Standard Operating 
Procedure.   
 
Officer Ronald Stoddard explained that Mr. King was stopped after they 
observed him walking between cars possibly looking through car windows.  He did not 
have any keys in his hands and it did not appear that he had a car in the lot.  He 
explained that the van drove up to Mr. King and they asked him where he was going.  
Mr. King stopped but he did not respond; instead, he put both hands behind his back.  
Officer Stoddard became alarmed so they all quickly exited the vehicle.  They 
commanded Mr. King to show his hands.  They asked for identification and said that 
Officer Wheeler explained that they were stopping him because there had been 
numerous break-ins.  They told him that in the future, he should walk around the 
parking lots instead of walking through them.  They did not frisk or cuff Mr. King, nor 
did they put their hands on him at any time during the encounter.

A check of the police radio transmissions and the vehicle’s Mobile Data 
Transmissions was performed and no record was found of an inquiry for Mr. King.  The 
Board noted that the officers did not follow the procedure concerning stops of 
suspicious persons (S.O.P. 3065, Section 4.1.1).   
 
The Board considered the evidence and voted to sustain the allegation of 
Unlawful Imprisonment.  The Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement officers to 
briefly detain individuals for investigatory purposes if the officers reasonably suspect 
that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.  
Furthermore, the US Supreme Court has adopted a dual inquiry for evaluating the 
reasonableness of an investigative stop, to wit, “whether the officer’s action was 
justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the 
circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.”  Mr. King was stopped 
for walking in the Lenox Square Mall parking lot.  One of the officers said that Mr. 
King might have been looking in car windows.  He also had no car keys.  This is not 
reasonable suspicion.   
 
The Board discussed some of the factual issues that arose as a result of the 
investigation.  These three officers were all new officers.  There was no senior officer 
assigned to this patrol team.  Also, the officers failed to inform the dispatcher about the 
stop.  This is a violation of policy.  Also, they were concerned that officers are no 
properly trained on the requirements of imposed by the Fourth Amendment when 
conducting stops.  The Board was of the opinion that the Department could benefit 
from more training regarding articulable suspicion, probable cause and when there is 
insufficient evidence to support a constitutional seizure.  For these reasons, the Board 
voted to recommend that you issue a written reprimand to the three officers and provide 
Department-wide training to help officers better understand Fourth Amendment law.  
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would like 
to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires that the Chief respond 
in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.  See Sec. 2-2211(O) of 
Ordinance 07-0-0141.

Inuiliating, terrifying.\nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive. signifying degradation and submission.."").. The\nFourth Amendment requires that the greater the intrusion, the greater the reason for\nconducting a search. The driver of this car was merely accused of running a stop sign\n‘nd appearing nervous. The passenger had a warrant for failure to appear on a traffic\ncharge. Your policy requires that strip searches be conducted at # correctional fecilty\nand afler a supervisor is advised of the need for the search. Your policy requires that\ncavity searches only be performed by qualified medical personnel. Given the number\nof complaints it appears that officers have been ill informed about these standards.\n\nPlease let me know if you will need any further information or would like =\ncopy of the investigation,\n\nSincerely,\n\na a 5\n\nJoy Morrissey,\nBoard Chair\n\nce: Mayor Kasim Reed\nCounc President Ceasar Mitchell\nMembers of Atlanta City Council\nACRB Members\n\n""Standards 9d Glee fr era Afan: Recommendation froma Community of Pate US Dpartinent of sti, Ofice of\n‘Comment Onentea Poles Serees, 6. 52\n\n‘nape do pile CTPuition/e060930210 ernie pt\n']"

Mr. Bowser\nsaid that Officer King told him to step outside the apartment but he refused and asked\n‘what was going on. He claims Officer King snatched him out ofthe doorway, into the\n‘all and told the female officer to handeuff him. Me. Bowser asked why he was being\narrested and Officer King pointed o one ofthe maintenance men and told him that it was\nfor iting him. Mr. Bowser said he told Officer King he didnot hit either of the men, but\naccording to Mr. Bowser, Officer King said, “your 3s is sil going to jail. 1am tired of\nYour fucking ass calling my cell phone leaving messages.” He claims that Officer King\n‘also said that he was tied of him coming ito the office complaining and he was going to\nmake sure that Mr. Bowser was taught a lesson by geting him kicked oat of the\napartment building. ‘The female officer took him into custody and he explained io her that\nhe did not hit anyone and he was being retaliated against for wanting things fixed in his\napartment. Mr. Bowser spent 23 hours inthe Fulton County Jil and was released and the\ncharges were dismissed. Two days later, he received a letter from the landlord notifying\nhim that his lease was terminated. He believes that Officer King retaliated against him\n‘or making complaints. Officer King is employed as a courtesy officer in the apartment\nbuilding where Mr. Bowser lived.\n\nCOfcer Clink was the female officer dispatched tothe apartment. She was out on\nmedical leave so she was not interviewed.

RE: Complaint of Jeremiah Ervin #11-13 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation 
and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by Jeremiah Ervin alleging 
excessive force by members of the Atlanta and Marta Police Departments.  The 
complaint was investigated by Investigator Sheena Robertson. 
 
Mr. Ervin wrote a letter to the Board dated February 28, 2011, stating that 
he was currently incarcerated and was the subject of excessive force by members 
of the Marta Police Department and the Atlanta Police Department on February 2, 
2011.  He said that he was arrested on a warrant after a foot pursuit.  He was 
“tasered” and taken to the ground and claims that officers ripped off his clothing 
and forced his face into the concrete and kicked him.  Two of his teeth were 
shattered and then he was picked up off the ground and slammed back on the 
ground and was smacked by a Marta police officer.  He said he was knocked to 
the ground and was held there by an officer who had a knee on his back.  He said 
an officer smacked him with handcuffs and he lost two more teeth.  He was 
transported to Grady Emergency Room and was treated before he was taken to the 
Fulton County Jail.  He claimed that he believed that members of the Atlanta 
Police Department were involved in his arrest because he saw Atlanta Police 
vehicles in the area. 
 
The investigation focused on whether there were any Atlanta Police 
officers involved in this arrest or use of force.  The daily activity reports for 
officers working on that day in Zone 5 were obtained.  There was no indication 
they responded to this incident.  The radio transmissions for Zone 5 were also 
reviewed and there was no indication that any Zone officer responded to the scene 
of the arrest.  The reports from Marta Police do not indicate that the Atlanta Police 
were involved in this incident.  Additionally, according to Captain Joseph 
Spillane, no Atlanta officers assisted Marta Police with the apprehension of Mr. 
Ervin.

Given the above evidence, the Atlanta Citizen Review Board voted 
unanimously to assign a finding of Unfounded to this allegation. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would like 
to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires that the Chief respond 
in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.  See Sec. 2-2211(O) of 
Ordinance 07-0-0141.

RE: Complaint of George Nelson, #11-14 
 
 
Dear Chief Turner: 
 
The Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) completed its investigation 
and adjudication of the complaint that was filed by George Nelson alleging 
abusive language and excessive force by Officer Leif Reddick.  The complaint 
was investigated by Investigator Marc Addington.  
 
Mr. Nelson filed a complaint on March 22, 2011 alleging that on October 
1, 2010, near the intersection of Carol Drive and Chattahoochee Avenue, he was 
confronted by Officer Leif Reddick.  Mr. Nelson explained that he was out with 
two clients of his security business and was approached by Officer Reddick who 
told him to put his hands up or he would “blow his fucking head off.”  Nelson 
claimed that the officer repeated this phrase four times.  The officer also pointed a 
gun at him and handcuffed him and detained him for four hours.   
 
An interview was conducted with Adam Brock, who was the client who 
was present at the time of the stop.  He said that Mr. Nelson had a red strobe light 
activated on his dash board, as they were discussing security for a property owned 
by his father.  The officer approached and began to ask questions about their 
identity and what they were doing on the street.  Mr. Brock claimed that he did 
not recall whether the officer approached with his weapon drawn or whether he 
heard the officer use any abusive language.  He said that both Nelson and his 
brother, Matt Brock, were handcuffed by the officer.  The officer appeared 
concerned about the identification and the badge that Mr. Nelson presented to the 
officer.  He estimated that the detention of his brother was for one to two hours 
and Mr. Nelson remained at the scene after he and his brother were allowed to 
leave the location.

Officer Reddick stated that he observed a car with a red strobe light as he was 
en route to the APD Property office.  He said that he was informed at previous roll calls 
that there had been some robberies perpetrated by persons who were impersonating 
police officers, so he decided to turn around and investigate the situation.  According to 
Officer Reddick, he observed three men at the location and one was dressed in dark 
clothing and was wearing a gun belt which contained a firearm.  He said he approached 
with his weapon drawn and ordered them to place their hands on the vehicle for his 
safety.  Officer Reddick said that he keyed the microphone of his radio so that the 
dispatcher would hear and send more units.  He handcuffed Mr. Nelson and one other 
person.  He removed a Glock semi-automatic pistol from Mr. Nelson’s holster and Mr. 
Nelson gave him an identification card that looked like those that are issued to Atlanta 
Police officers.  He also produced a badge that resembled the badges worn by Georgia 
State Patrol Troopers.  Officer Reddick requested the presence of a Georgia State Patrol 
Officer in order to investigate whether the Mr. Reddick was in lawful possession of this 
badge.  After a period of time, Officer Reddick was informed that there was no trooper 
available to respond.  He discussed the situation with his supervisor and spoke with a 
Georgia State Patrol officer by telephone.  He cited Mr. Nelson for using the red strobe 
light without a permit.  When asked whether he used profanity, he could not recall the 
exact words he used but said that he probably did.  
 
Given the evidence in this matter, the Atlanta Citizen Review Board voted to 
Not Sustain the allegation of Excessive Force and to recommend a finding of 
Sustained as to the Abusive Language.  Officer Reddick has no disciplinary history.  
For that reason, the Board recommends that you issue an oral reprimand to Officer 
Reddick for the use of abusive language. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns or if you would like 
to have a copy of the full investigation.  The ordinance requires that the Chief respond 
in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief.  See Sec. 2-2211(O) of 
Ordinance 07-0-0141. 
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Joy Morrissey, 
Board Chair

Officer Layton\n<laimed that he pursed the complainant's vehicle out of concern that a road rage incident was\n‘occurring. Officer Layton’s inability to mention or describe a second vehicle that was involved inthis\nincident calls ito question, the valty of the stop and detention duc to the lack of probable cause that\na tafe offense or crime had occurred.

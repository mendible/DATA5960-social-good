Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has

The board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the false arrest claim 
be assigned a finding of “Exonerated” (the investigation established that the 
alleged act(s) occurred but were justified, legal or properly within 
Departmental policy).  
 
2. The allegation of Violation of Atlanta Police Department’s Standard 
Operating Procedures related to the illegal tow claim be assigned a finding of

3. Officer Thigpen used profane language during his interaction with 
 
and therefore, the allegation of Abusive Language be assigned a finding of 
“Sustained” (the investigation established by a preponderance of the evidence 
that the officer committed the alleged act(s) of misconduct) and recommends, 
as penalty, an Oral Admonishment. 
 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a

RE: Complaint of 
, ACRB File  
No. 22-013 
 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on November 8, 2021, Officers Matthew Gordon (Unique ID 
No. 6855) and Aiyonna Parks (Unique ID No. 7336): (1) falsely arrested her, (2) 
used abusive language when they shouted profanities at her, (3) used excessive force 
when they used their ASP batons to burst her car windows, pull her out of her 
vehicle, punch her in the face multiple times, and twisted her arms while placing her 
in handcuffs, and (4) treated her inhumanly when they placed her in the patrol car 
with the heat turned up and refused to lower the windows and give her water after 
she complained that she could not breathe. 
 
 
The board determined the following for Officers Gordon and Parks: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the false 
arrest claim be assigned a finding of “Exonerated” (the investigation 
established that the alleged act(s) occurred but were justified, legal or 
properly within Departmental policy).  
 
2. The allegation of Abusive Language be assigned a finding of “Not 
Sustained” (the investigation failed to prove or disprove that the alleged 
act(s) occurred). 
 
3. The allegation of Excessive Force be assigned a finding of 
“Exonerated.”

4. The allegation of Violation of Atlanta Police Department’s Standard Operating 
Procedures related to the inhumane treatment claim be assigned a finding of

occur). 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or will be 
implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the Board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the

RE: 
Complaint of

File No. 22-106 
 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
.  Ms. 
 alleged that on October 15, 2022, former Investigator 
Mark Olson (Unique ID No. 4056), while working as a courtesy officer at the 
Generation Atlanta apartment complex: (1) abused his authority when he entered 
her private party and ordered her to turn down the music, (2) was inappropriate 
when he told her, “You need to turn or shut this shit down,” (3) was not wearing 
his Atlanta Police Department (“APD”) issued uniform, and (4) was not wearing 
a body worn camera (“BWC”). 
 
 
The board determined the following: 
1. The allegation of Abuse of Authority be assigned a finding of 
“Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a three (3) day 
suspension. 
2. The allegation of Abusive Language be assigned a finding of 
“Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a Written 
Reprimand. 
3. The allegation of Violation of Atlanta Police Department’s 
(APD’s) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) related to 
Investigator Olson working as a courtesy officer at the incident 
location without an Extra Job Permit on file be assigned a finding 
of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a three (3) day 
suspension.

4. The allegation of Violation of APD’s SOPs related to Investigator Olson 
not wearing and activating his APD issued BWC while working as a 
courtesy officer at the incident location be assigned a finding of 
“Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a ten (10) day suspension 
and Training on the SOP governing BWCs. 
5. The allegation of Violation of APD’s SOPs related to Investigator Olson 
not wearing his APD issued uniform while working as a courtesy officer 
at the incident location be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and 
recommends, as penalty, a Written Reprimand. 
 
 
The board also recommends that Investigator Olson receives training on 
professionalism.  While the board did not investigate Investigator Olson returning to the 
party for drinks with the patron, the board recommends that the APD address this issue to 
determine the appropriateness of the action in light of the complaint allegations. 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
of Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or 
will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the

Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on June 28, 2021, Officer Monise Antoine (Unique ID No. 
5153) failed to conduct an adequate investigation into her hit and run accident.  Ms. 
 further alleged that Sergeant Adam Wright (Unique ID No. 2478) failed to 
assign her hit and run case to an investigator in a timely manner which resulted in the 
loss of pertinent evidence that could have helped her case. 
 
 
The board determined the following: 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
inadequate 
investigation 
claim 
be 
assigned 
a 
finding 
of 
“Unfounded.” 
2. The allegation of Violation of Atlanta Police Department’s 
Standard Operating Procedures related to the untimely assignment 
claim be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as 
penalty, a Written Reprimand and Training focusing on his duty 
as a unit supervisor to review accident reports and assign the case 
for further investigation timely. 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the 
Chief of Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, 
rejected, or will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the 
submission of a recommendation for action by the board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-

RE: 
Complaint of 
 ACRB File 
No. 22-041 
 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
.  Ms. 
 alleged that on March 28, 2022, Officer Austin Thigpen (Unique 
ID No. 7010): (1) falsely arrested her, (2) refused to give her medications, (3) 
placed her in a hot patrol car and refused to turn on the air conditioner, (4) 
refused to loosen her handcuffs when she complained they were too tight, and (5) 
confiscated her cellphone. 
 
 
The board determined the following: 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
false arrest claim be assigned a finding of “Exonerated”. 
2. The allegation of Violation of Atlanta Police Department’s 
(“APD’s”) Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) related 
to the refusal to give medication claim be assigned a finding of 
“Exonerated”. 
3. The allegation of Violation of APD’s SOPs related to the being 
placed in a hot patrol car claim be assigned a finding of 
“Unfounded”. 
4. The allegation of Violation of APD’s SOPs related to the refusal 
to loosen handcuffs claim be assigned a finding of “Unfounded”. 
5. The allegation of Violation of APD’s SOPs related to the 
confiscated cellphone claim be assigned a finding of

While the evidence showed that Ms. 
 did not complain to Officer Thigpen that 
the handcuffs were too tight, she did complain to Officer Thigpen’s supervisor when he 
responded to the scene and the supervisor immediately readjusted them.  The supervisor 
then advised Officer Thigpen that Ms. 
 handcuffs were applied “way too tight” and 
he needed to ensure that he always checked them for tightness.  Therefore, the board 
recommends that Officer Thigpen obtains re-fresher training on how to properly 
apply handcuffs on arrestees/detainees. 
 
The file is available for review upon request.  The ordinance requires that the Chief 
of Police respond in writing regarding which recommendations are accepted, rejected, or 
will be implemented with modifications within thirty (30) days of the submission of a 
recommendation for action by the board to the Chief (see Sec. 2-2211(O) of the 
Ordinance 07-0-0141).

RE: 
Complaint of 
, ACRB 
File No. 23-017 
 
 
Dear Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on January 28, 2023, when Officer Monica Mills (Unique ID 
No. 7180) responded to his assault call, she: (1) failed to provide adequate service 
in that she did not arrest his assailant, and (2) failed to complete an accurate report. 
 
The board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
inadequate service be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and 
recommends, as penalty, a Written Reprimand. 
2. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures related to the inaccurate report claim be assigned a 
finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a Written 
Reprimand and Training on report writing. 
The board further determined that the APD should ensure that officers 
responding to the scene of incident, as part of their preliminary investigation, 
contact dispatch to request additional information about the 9-1-1 caller and make 
attempts to contact the caller to determine if the caller is an unbiased witness with 
relevant information.

concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
 alleging that on June 7, 2023, Retired Officer Christopher Tanner 
(Unique ID No. 2012): (1) showed a lack of courtesy when he yelled and treated 
him as if he was “dumb” after issuing him a citation, and (2) violated an Atlanta 
City Ordinance by smoking within ten (10) feet of an Atlanta City Building. 
 
The board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Conduct related to the unlawful stop claim be 
assigned a finding of “Not Sustained.” 
2. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures related to violating a city ordinance be assigned a finding 
of “Unfounded.” 
3. The allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating 
Procedures related to the failure to have an approved Extra Job Permit 
on file be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as 
penalty, an Oral Admonishment.  
The board also recommends that the APD ensures that all officers, 
including those who are currently in their retired reserved program and are 
performing approved extra jobs, are issued body worn cameras and trained 
accordingly.

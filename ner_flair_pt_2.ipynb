      "In  13.43  force report he stated, \"I believe Officer Appleton's documented use of  force, open handed slaps, may have been justified if she felt threatened\". When I asked  13.43  what he meant by this statement, he said that people were different sizes and  situations are different where if an officer felt threatened by a handcuffed AP, then a slap  in the face would be appropriate.  13.43  said that was one reason why he sent Officer Appledorn's report back,  because he thought she needed more detail about the behavior of the AP and how Officer  Appledorn may have felt threatened by \"this guy making furtive movements towards her  that weren't described in her report or some kind of threatening gesture, that I think may  justify an open hand distraction slap. But I felt that it needed more detail\".  said he also returned the report because there was no force report.  13.43  13.43  said he was present for bar closing on that night, but that he was assisting  another Officer with an arrest and did not see Officer Appledorn make her arrest.  13.43 said Officer Appledorn did not mention any other officers who may have assisted  with the arrest. He said he spoke to Officer Appledorn after he had sent her report back  to her, to ask her if she got a chance to look at the report he had sent back to her.  13.43  said he couldn't remember Officer Appleton's exact words, but she told  him she didn't think that she had done anything inappropriate or \"I don't think I did  anything wrong, because I used open hand techniques not a closed fist\".  said  he told Officer Appledorn, \"Well based on what you told me an open hand strike is  reportable use of force and you didn't do the force screen and I didn't know. I wasn't  notified of the force review that was needed to be done and I said, you know I kicked it  back to you so you could look at it and review it and find out did I miss something\"  5  13.43  1212290 13.43 said he told Appledorn that her report was missing the facts that supported an  open hand slap. He said he told her \"but irregardless of that, you need to notify a  supervisor\". 13.43 said Officer Appledorn said she would take a look at the report.

When I asked  13.43  13.43  said that Karma was one of those problem  if he had gone over Officer Appleton's duties with her, he  said that he had and gave me a Memo that was to Officer Appledorn and 13.43  Supervisors, dated, 4/26/10. The memo was regarding, Karma and Epic Enforcement  Options. This memo was basically telling Officer Appledorn what problems the Karma  Night Club was having and suggestions to both officer Appledorn and  supervisors about how things should be handled.  13.43  6  1212291 13.43 said he was Officer Appleton's direct supervisor, but any  13.43  supervisor would be her supervisor and would know what her duties were per the memo  he sent them.  13.43 said if Officer Appledorn was at Karma Night Club assisting in  making arrest, she would have been doing part of her required duties as an officer.

      "Minneapolis Officer Tyrone Barze Investigated  Again for Police Brutality  Tuesday, April 21, 2015 by Susan Du in News   http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-officer-tyrone-barze-investigated-again-for-police-brutality- 6544768    About 1,000 people gathered in downtown Minneapolis this winter in protest of police shootings.   In the latest excessive force lawsuit filed against Minneapolis Police Officer Tyrone Barze, a doctoral student  alleges Barze swiped her phone out of her hands when she tried to record him and then punched her in the face,  knocked her out, and left her bleeding in the street.  Madelyn Milton says she sustained a traumatic brain injury when her head struck the pavement.  See also: Minneapolis Paying Dontae Thomas $25K and His Lawyers $115K to Settle Cop Chokehold Suit   The police won't comment on pending litigation, but they do promise to do a thorough investigation of what  actually happened the night of June 1, 2014.  According to the lawsuit, Milton and a bunch of friends were arguing with a cabbie over their fare when Barze  arrived to sort out the dispute. He ordered the group to pay up, but they refused.  A couple people then pulled out their phones to start recording Barze, Milton among them. The suit alleges that  at this point, Barze confiscated all the phones and started making arrests. When Milton took a couple steps  forward in protest, Barze allegedly threw his fist into her face.    Officer Tyrone Barze Jr. making a peace sign for the cameras in September 2014.  This is all pretty difficult to fathom, but it turns out Barze isn't new to accusations of misconduct. The city just  recently agreed to settle with Dontae Thomas, a Patrick Henry High School student whom Barze put in a  chokehold. Barze's version of that incident accuses Thomas of trying to incite a fight between black and Hmong  students. Thomas maintained that Barze choked him until he passed out because he wouldn't stand up for a  search. Either way, the city of Minneapolis is $140,000 poorer for the altercation.  Then, Barze was accused of tackling Navell Gordon, a voting rights canvasser, while he went door to door in  north Minneapolis asking people to sign a petition. Witnesses with the nonprofit Neighborhoods Organizing for  Change said Barze threatened to shoot them for protesting Gordon's arrest.  According to the Star Trib, Barze has also been sued for pepper spraying the general manager of an Uptown  bar. The city settled that one for $34,000.  Send news tips to Susan Du.\n",

      "1  Despite Officer 1 3 .43 documenting that he and other officers were in \"direct  proximi i \" • Pa, e, when Page fell to the ground, Officer Bartholomew contradicted  Officer 13.43 report when Officer Bartholomew confirmed to this investigator that  he was the only officer present with AP2/Page when he kicked Page in the head. 2 \u0013 Officer Suchta stated that when he actually arrived at the location where officers  apprehended AP2/Page, Officers Bartholomew, 13.43 and 13.43 were present. Officer  Suchta stated that including him, four officers were present.  ,( Officer Bartholomew further documented that after he kicked AP2/Page two times in the  head, he then got on top of AP2/Page's back and did not feel safe because AP2/Page's  hands were underneath his body and Officer Bartholomew could not see them. Officer  Bartholomew immediately punched AP2/Page three times in the face with a closed fist.  At this time, Officer Bartholomew was able to control AP2/Page's left arm and another  officer (Officer Suchta) informed Officer Bartholomew that he secured Page's right hand.  Officer Bartholomew then handcuffed AP2/Page.I4 1 Officer Mark Suchta's statement contradicts Officer Bartholomew's statement regarding  Officer Bartholomew being alone with AP2/Page during the time Officer Bartholomew  kicked Page in the head followed by Officer Bartholomew's three immediate punches to  Page's face. Officer Suchta stated that after a long struggle, he was able to control Page's  right arm.  During this time, Officer Suchta was communicating with Officer  Bartholomew to  • •  intro • 'age's left arm. Officer Suchta stated that officers  (Bartholomew, 13.43 and 13.43 1 had already taken Page to the ground and they were  fighting with Page for at least ten seconds.I5 1 This is a significant contradiction. Officer Bartholomew documented that his three  punches to Page's face came immediately after his two kicks to Page's head. Officer  Bartholomew documented that he was able to control Page's left arm at that time and  (Officer Suchta) informed him that Page's right arm was under control allowing Officer  Bartholomew the ability to handcuff Page. Based on Officers' Bartholomew and Suchta  statements, Officer Suchta was engaged with Page during the approximate time Officer  Bartholomew kicked and punched Page in the head to gain control of Page's arms.  Officer Suchta stated that when he arrived, he observed Page digging into his waistband.  Officer Suchta grabbed Page's right arm and placed Page's right arm in a gooseneck  position while kneeling on Page's back. Officer Suchta stated that it was a fight to hold  onto Page's right arm. Officer Suchta was yelling at Officer Bartholomew to get Page's  left arm. Officer Bartholomew had a real difficult time getting Page's left arm behind his  back. Officer Suchta stated that between him and Officer Bartholomew, it took the two  of them approximately 45 seconds to get both of Page's arms behind his back and  handcuff Page. 16 12 Bartholomew Statement Pg. 4 Lines 9-12  13 Suchta Statement Pg. 3 Lines 1-4  14 MPLS CAPRS Report 11-016025 Supplement 7 / Bartholomew Statement Pg. 5 Lines 11-15, 17-20, & 25-27  15 Suchta Statement Pg. 2 Lines 27-31 & 34-37 / Pg. 6 Lines 15-19  16 MPLS CAPRS Report 11-016025 Supplement 7 / Suchta Statement Pg. 4 Lines 28-42  19  1210153 \u0013 Officer 13.43 - Personnel Data 's statement also contradicts Officer Bartholomew's  statement regarding Officer Bartholomew being alone with AP2/Page during the time he  kicked Page in the head.

Officer 13.43 stated that he arrived at the apprehension  location of AP2/Page at approximately the same time as Officer Suchta.'8 \u0013 Based on the statements of Officers Bartholomew, Suchta, 13.43 and 13.43 it has  been determined that Officer  13.43 was the third officer to arrive at  ' /Page's  apprehension location. The order of officers' arrival at the apprehension location of  AP2/Pa e was as follows: first Officer Bartholomew, second Officer 13.43 third  Officer 13.43 fourth Officer Suchta and fifth Officer  19  \u0013 Officer Bartholomew may have been the first officer to engage AP2/Page physically, but  assisting officers appeared to arrive at the same time or within seconds after Officer  Bartholomew.

After reviewing Officers Bartholomew,  and Suchta, their supplemental reports #'s 7 5 2, 6 and 1 respectively, the kicking force used by  Officers Bartholomew, 13.43 and 13.43 appeared to be unreasonable.  13.43 respectively  the incident involvin  Officers Bartholomew, 13.43 and 13.43 reported that they made the decision to use the  force that they used against AP2/Page based on information from a CRI, that the CRI observed  an alleged gun in the waistband of AP2/Page during two different controlled buys. Officers  stated that Page was digging in his waistband during the brief foot pursuit but described Page's  clothing as baggie and loose fitting. Officers stated that when Page was lying on the ground, he  continued to reach for his waistband, kick his legs and swing his arms.  Officers' descriptions of AP2/Page's action were resisting officers' attempts to gain control of  Page. Page was not aggressively fighting officers. Page was lying on the ground on his  stomach. Page was pulling away form officers. Page was trying to roll over. Page was kicking  his feet and swinging his arms while lying on the ground on his stomach.  Officers need to maintain their safety using information that they obtain to heighten their  awareness. Officers' actions against AP2/Page should have been based on dangers that existed  at the time and not assumptions and possibilities. With five officers present and AP2/Page lying  on the ground on his stomach with no apparent dan_ers resent  13.43 respectively  AP2/Page in the head,  body and groin by Officers Bartholomew, 13.43 and  3  respectively appeared to be  unreasonable.  13.43 - Personnel Data  Regarding allegation 5, Sergeant Robinson must have the capabili  of Imderstandinwhen  force appears to be unreasonable.  When Officers Bartholomew, 1 3 .43 and 13.43 informed Sergeant Robinson that they kicked AP2/Page in his head, body and groin  respectively, it is prudent for Sergeant Robinson to ensure that probable cause currently existed  during the use of force by officers. Officers' assumptions and possibilities do not create  Probable cause.  13.43 - Personnel Data  Respectfully  Montg  Internal Aff  nit  31  1210165\n",

      "August 25, 2018    Ms. Gail O’Kane  Vice President of Academic Affairs  Minneapolis Community and Technical College  1501 Hennepin Avenue  Minneapolis, MN 55403    Dear Ms. O’Kane:    We are in receipt of your September to December 2018 Continuing Education course catalog.  On  page 32 of this catalog, the courses De-escalation of a Crisis and Mental Health Crisis Response are  listed.  Tyrone Barze is shown as the instructor for both courses.    Tyrone Barze is a Minneapolis Police Officer with an extensive record of complaints and lawsuits  against him for excessive force and offensive speech and conduct.  Since October 2012, Ofc. Barze  has had eight (8) complaints against him by members of the community.  Ofc. Barze has also been  the defendant in seven (7) lawsuits for excessive force, wrongful arrest and other misconduct  between 2012 and 2015.  A synopsis of these lawsuits and media articles about them are enclosed.   A number of these suits include information that Ofc. Barze seized and destroyed cell phones or  deleted footage that captured his conduct, an unconstitutional action.    With his history of excessive force, false arrests, and camera seizures, Ofc. Tyrone Barze is wholly  unqualified to teach courses in de-escalation and addressing mental health crises.  The Minnesota  Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) Board relies on accreditated sponsors to select  appropriate instructors for the courses they will teach.  We insist you find a different instructor or  cancel these courses.    We are deeply disappointed at your selection of Tyrone Barze as an instructor for these courses and  insist you rectify this situation immediately.  Failure to do so harms the students who pay for these  courses as well as the public who relies on police officers to engage in genuine de-escalation.    For justice,    Michelle F.

      "13.43 - Personnel Data said he did not see any other officers assisting officer Appledorn with  any arrests, but he thought he saw the booking van there.  When I asked 13.43 - Personnel Data if he remembered what the suspect looked like, that  Officer Appledorn was dealing with he said; \"I think it was a guy. I think he was African  American\".  13.43 - Personnel Data did remember  13.43  discussing Officer Appledom's report  with him. He said; \"the only thing I can remember is just the force reporting part of it.  We talked about that briefly\". 13.43 - Personnel Data said basically that  13.43  and he  talked about Officer Appledorn not doing a force report or that they thought she needed  to do a force report.  Statement of Officer• Sherry Appledorn  On June 03, 2010 at 1000 hrs, I interviewed Officer Appledorn at the Internal Affairs  office. Also in attendance was Officer Appledom's Federation Representative, Dan  Ungurian. I read Officer Appledorn Garrity and Tennessen Warnings and she said she  understood both.  Officer Appledom said on the morning of 04/25/10, she was outside Karma Night  club doing surveillance. She said she was wearing jeans, but she had on a MPD jacket,  with her duty belt on. She said it was obvious that she was a MPD police officer. She  said she was standing outside the night club, when she saw a man, (AP Ross) going  directly for one of the bouncers \"and then just punched the bouncer\". Officer Appledorn  said once she saw that happen, she ran up to AP Ross and grabbed him from behind.  Officer Appledom said the man was over six foot tall, with a heavy muscular build, so  it was hard for her when she was trying to pull him back. She said she couldn't pull the  8  1212293 AP back so \"luckily another bouncer, who was a huge big guy, helped me pull him back  out of the crowd\".  Officer Appledorn said when she got the AP back near the trunk of her car, with the  help of the bouncer; she tried to put handcuffs on AP Ross. She said Ross kept moving  and was not listening to her give him orders. She said with the bouncer helping her, she  was finally able to get API's hands behind his back and handcuffed. Officer Appledom  said once AP Ross was handcuffed, \"The bouncer kind of just disappears on me and so  now I'm standing here left with this guy who's pissed mad and I'm asking him like three  or four times just to please just sit on the ground, you're under arrest, you're going to jail,  we have to wait for the booking van\".  Officer Appledorn said she was trying to get Ross down to the ground by the squad,  because her vehicle was an unmarked and another squad near by had an arrested female  in the back seat, so she didn't want to put a male with a female. Officer Appledom said  she tried to get Ross \"down just so nothing else happens with any other fights going on,  so he doesn't get injured. And I'm trying to move his feet to get him just to sit down and  he's not and he's pushing off the squad backing up into me at the same time I'm trying to  push him, bend him over\".  Officer Appledom said AP Ross was pushing off the squad with his body, at the same  time he was backing his feet up and backing Officer Appledorn. Officer Appledorn said  she believed that the AP was trying to head butt, so at that time, \"I open hand, gave him  just like an attention slap at the same time then I was able to get his, move his feet and  get him on the ground\".  9  1212294 Officer Appledorn said she believed she slapped AP1 on the side of his cheek. She  said she did it from behind so there was \"no full swing or anything it was just enough to  kind of hey, you know, you need to sit\". Officer Appledorn said once she slapped AP1  she was able to get him to the ground.  When I asked Officer Appledorn if any other MPD officers helped her with AP Ross  besides the bouncer, she said; \"Yeah, eventually when I got him on the ground then he  started, he started kicking and screaming and yelling on the ground and two other cops  came over and I don't know who they were and then  13.43 - Personnel Data  came over and  13.43 - Personnel Data was talking to him and then one cop was by his waist and one was on  his feet, holding his feet cause now he was kicking and kicking his, thrashing his feet all  about and kicking and at that time 13.43 was like go, go talk to the, I told him what  happened and then he was like go and so I went and talked to the victim, the bouncer\".  Officer Appledorn said she believed  13.43  was also at her call, but she didn't  know. She said 13.43 - Personnel Data and the other officers, who she couldn't remember,  waited with AP Ross until the booking van came.  Officer Appledorn said she is no longer assigned to the 13.43 - Personnel Data Unit. She  said the day that she received her notification of allegation of misconduct from Internal  Affairs; she was transferred to  13.43 - Personnel Data  When I asked Officer Appledorn about her CAPRS supplement, (page 1 of 1),  specifically the part where she said, \"he was already secured and handcuffed at this  point\" and he pushed off the squad but that he wouldn't sit down so she slapped AP1 in  the face as a distraction measure.  10  1212295 I asked if he sat down when she slapped AP 1. She said; \"Yeah I was able to give him  the, I mean I had to physically get him to sit down at the same time. It was, I couldn't get  his, I couldn't kick his feet out in order to take him down so I had to kind a, with  distracting him and then I had to kind of physically get him to sit in order to take him  down on the ground so he would sit there\".  When I asked Officer Appledorn when she slapped AP1 in the face if she perceived  that as force. Officer Appledorn said she did not perceive a slap in the face as force. She  said it was a distraction technique and a way to get AP1 attention and get him to sit on  the ground. Officer Appledorn said she didn't do a force report because her actions were  not force.  When I asked Officer Appledorn if she still believed that she didn't use force, she  responded, \"Correct, yes\". When I showed Officer Appledorn the Use of Force policy  and showed her where it stated, \"any physical strike to any part of the body of another\"  and that a slap to the face would still be force, she replied; \"Well I'm taking it as part of a  take down technique\".  I then asked Officer Appledorn if she had ever had any defensive tactics training that  included slapping the face as a take down measure or distraction measure. Officer  Appledorn replied, \"They talk about using open hand slaps as a way for distraction when  we do use of force, so\".  Officer Appledorn remembered  13.43  speaking to her about her report. She  remembered  13.43  expressing concern that she did not do a use of force report, for  slapping AP Ross after he was handcuffed. Officer Appledorn said she told  13.43  11  1212296\n",

Accordingly, Face2Face works toward enlightening and inspiring individuals to realize their potential in empowering and uplifting the community as a whole. While Face2Face is something of a Ùedgling endeavor, going on its second year, it has functioned, in the form of founder-director Anthijuan Beeks, Sr., for quite some time. Educational facilitator Beeks, born and raised in the Minneapolis inner city, having lived on both the North and South sides, delivers a message he has learned Ørsthand over his lifetime and career. A graduate of Minneapolis Public Schools, Beeks joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2004. In addition to serving on patrol, he has been a school resources ofØcer and worked with the Police        3/15/2021 Mpls cop goes beyond traditional policing https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/09/17/mpls-cop-goes-beyond-traditional-policing/ 2/9 Activity League (PAL). “I was doing the same service, motivational [and] educational speaking, for years. I’ve found there is a strong need and therefore took it to the next level.” He had seen what he describes as “a lot of issues occurring in the community. Young men growing up without fathers, the poverty, people being homeless, crime — just a whole ton of issues. My goal in life was to follow in my mother’s footsteps and become a law enforcement ofØcer in order to try to change the world, so to speak.” Without question, the world of which he speaks historically has been in need of changing. Beeks links his mother to an issue the community continues to face and he addresses through his motivational speaking — domestic violence. During his tenure with the MPD and through connections his mom had made over the course of her 11 years on the force, he was able to interface with and help members of the community “Ønd opportunities for jobs, education, things of that nature.” He states that as a police ofØcer he could see the community’s “trials and tribulations from the other side of the fence. I felt there was something I could do other than just [being] an African American ofØcer. That’s how I got into the whole motivational and educational speaking piece.” He adds, stating what hardly is news, “In the African American community, they do not look upon law enforcement highly. However, I knew I had the experience, knowledge.” In this regard, he was able to incorporate in Face2Face a component that includes, among other aspects, addressing matters of parental custody from a “law enforcement perspective.” On the website there are lists of topics with which the community is greatly concerned, such as gangs, drugs, and truancy from school. “I have a diverse background with much to offer.” The crux of it all, he states, is “what I’ve learned from growing up a male in the community put together with my experience as an ofØcer.” Indeed a signiØcant combination, putting his 12 years with the MPD together with his entire life in the community. Today, Face2Face effects outreach to, he notes, “various organizations, whether it’s schools, churches, programs.” Beeks isn’t doing it all by himself. His wife, Syrina Beeks (Syrina Jackson on the website), is director of administration for Face2Face. He considers her “the backbone and brains of the operation [who] spends many hours on the curriculum, making sure it’s solid with all the necessary information.” 3/15/2021 Mpls cop goes beyond traditional policing https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/09/17/mpls-cop-goes-beyond-traditional-policing/ 3/9 Via email, Syrina Beeks comments, “Face2Face is designed by [someone] who has grown up in the same communities in which he later served as a law enforcement ofØcer. I had the opportunity to meet him about four years ago, and I have always known him to care about others. “He consistently spoke to me about community-orientated policing. He became frustrated when certain opportunities weren’t granted to him and other opportunities were opposed within his previous organization. “He came to me with this idea to reach communities abroad, and this is when Face2Face came to life,” she continues. “I knew with his loyalty, dedication and passion he would have a huge impact on communities. “I believe the unique thing about this entire program is what he teaches, and how he teaches has a profound impact on lives because he has overcome a lot of those same concerns others face daily. And in today’s society, there are way too many caught in a cycle that can be very unforgiving, and the last person one would expect to get valuable information from is from a peace ofØcer.” “There is,”Anthijuan Beeks emphasizes, “a huge need for this service.” No argument there.   Dwight Hobbes welcomes reader responses to P.O.

To do nothing is not an option for me,\" Finney  said during a news conference called to discuss the officer's conduct  following the shooting death of Stephen Kuma at Arnellia's bar early Friday  morning. Discipline could range from an oral reprimand to termination.  Citing data privacy laws, Finney refused to identify the officer. But he  has been identified by patrons and bar owner Arnellia Allen as Cornelius  Benner IV.  Benner, a 10-year veteran who sometimes works off duty at the bar, has a  relatively clean internal-affairs record. He has been given three oral  reprimands and one written reprimand for off-duty work.  One included an infraction for working at Arnellia's without permission in  2002.  Finney said policy is that officers remain at the scene of a serious crime  even if they aren't on duty. At the very least, he said, the officer could  have given a description of the shooter to investigators.  \"It's my expectation that officers at the scene of a serious situation will  act professionally,\" Finney said. \"They should render aid to any victim.\"  On Monday, in a statement released on Benner's behalf by the St. Paul  Police Federation, the officer said he heard gunfire but didn't see anyone  get shot.  Benner, who admits he was drinking, said he was afraid for his safety and  left the bar because he had no gun, no badge and no bullet-proof vest. He  3/28/2021 Cop who left scene of deadly St. Paul shooting facing discipline https://alt.thebird.copwatch.narkive.com/lLfTZ0FD/cop-who-left-scene-of-deadly-st-paul-shooting-facing-discipline 2/4 said he left after confirming that 911 had been called.  \"If a person is fearing for his safety you can't require him to do  anything,\" Federation President David Titus said Monday afternoon.  Benner had his back to the door when he heard gunshots, according to the  statement. He fell to the floor as the gunman sprayed the bar.  Benner is the son of retired Sgt. Cornelius (Butch) Benner, who was  Finney's first partner on the force.  Finney said he could not discuss specifics of the incident at Arnellia's,  including reports that the officer was about two yards from Kuma when he  was shot and that he stepped over or around Kuma as he left.  Finney would not say whether Benner is still working or whether he is on  administrative leave. The chief did not offer a time line for the  conclusion of the investigation either.  The shooting was captured on video cameras, which the city had the bar  install because of a high number of police calls. The most serious incident  before last week's killing was in 1999 when a 28-year-old man died after  being run over by a 23-year-old Minneapolis man outside the bar.  Allen said Benner came in to talk to her about 10:30 p.m. Friday because  she wanted his advice on hiring off-duty officers. \"I didn't see him right  at the moment of the shooting,\" she said. \"I didn't see him after the  shooting.\"  Homicide investigators tracked down Benner at his home about 5 a.m. Friday  and ordered him to return to police headquarters to provide a statement,  the federation said.  Kuma's relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers were angry Monday.  \"Why would a police officer walk over a body like that?\" said Ikeco Powell,  a friend of Kuma's. \"Now they'll probably place him on paid leave, which is  just like a vacation.\"  Glenn Timti said his uncle, who would have turned 46 on Saturday, seldom  3/28/2021 Cop who left scene of deadly St. Paul shooting facing discipline https://alt.thebird.copwatch.narkive.com/lLfTZ0FD/cop-who-left-scene-of-deadly-st-paul-shooting-facing-discipline 3/4 17 years ago drank alcohol and stopped at Arnellia's to meet a friend. He said Kuma was  one of the older brothers in a family of seven siblings from the West  African nation of Cameroon. He emigrated to Minnesota about nine years ago and his job helping developmentally disabled people reflected his  altruistic nature.  \"He did everything he could for humanity and treated everyone as brothers  no matter their race or background,\" Timti said. \"He never wanted anything  to do with violence.\"  Bill Stich, program director at the Ramsey County-owned Lake Owasso  Residence, said Kuma handled the day-to-day needs of the residents for the  last two years.  \"He was very personable, pleasant, upbeat and well liked by the clients,\"  Stich said.  Charles Mitchell, a neighbor of Kuma's in an East Side apartment building,  said \"His heart was bigger than big . . . this is all so senseless.\"  Heron Marquez is at ***@startribune.com and Curt Brown is at  ***@startribune.com  zenner St. Paul's finest.  ... ---  Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.

He's been retired.  By STEVE BRANDT Star Tribune  JULY 19, 2011 — 12:29AM Sometimes cops get the wrong suspect. Sometimes police dogs bite the wrong man. That's why the city of Minneapolis is planning to pay $25,000 to one of its own, officer Bruce Johnson, and his attorney after one of its canine enforcers bit him on the hands and arms last Oct. 29. The attack on Johnson was one of at least two by Benny the police K-9, who has gone into retirement after costing the city $105,000 in legal settlements. \"The dog just got the wrong person,\" said Johnson's attorney, Robert Bennett. Bennett also represents Abel Miamen, who won an $80,000 settlement from the City Council on July 1 following an attack by Benny. \"The dog has had several incidents,\" Bennett said. According to a report to the council, Johnson, a 39-year veteran of the force, was working in uniform off-duty and using a marked squad car when he heard a call involving a police pursuit on the Broadway Avenue bridge. He arrived as the fleeing vehicle stopped, and officer John Bennett was pulling the suspect out of his vehicle to the ground. Benny ran past Bennett and the suspect and repeatedly bit Johnson. Johnson missed several weeks of work because of injuries and might need surgery, his attorney said. Benny is a 74-pound German Shepherd dog imported from Eastern Europe. He joined the department in 2003 for both patrol and narcotics duties. Bennett started with the department in 1990, and has been with the canine unit since 2003. The police department is reviewing the incident for potential discipline. The $25,000 award is over and above the worker compensation costs paid by the city for lost wages and medical expenses, Bennett said. He argued to the city that the matter constituted a civil rights violation because it represented excessive force. \"The dog shouldn't have been deployed the way it was deployed,\" he said. A City Council committee Monday approved the settlement urged by city lawyers, setting it up for full council approval on Friday. Steve Brandt • 612-673-4438 . Benny the police K-9 worked on Minneapolis patrol and narcotics squads, but several biting incidents have cost the city. The dog is now\n",

Andrew Layton was unconscious in the store’s entry when police oﬃcers arrived at about 4:40 a.m. Jan. 1. An initial news release only said he was arrested because he became combative, his heart stopped on the way to the jail in an ambulance and he was brought to the Mankato hospital after 3/24/2021 North Mankato man tasered by police before death, Mankato city ofﬁcials say | Local News | mankatofreepress.com https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/north-mankato-man-tasered-by-police-before-death-mankato-city-ofﬁcials-say/article_a7b201ba-6abe-5ed4-8fb… 2/4 he was revived. He died there Jan. 5 and the investigation was turned over to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. More public information about the incident was released Friday morning at the request of The Free Press. That report conﬁrmed that weapons were used during the arrest, but it didn’t say how many weapons or what type of weapons were used. City Manager Pat Hentges later conﬁrmed tasers were used during the incident.   The report also said the oﬃcers involved in the incident were Daniel Best, Kenneth Baker, Kyley Groby, Audrey Burgess and Cmdr. Craig Frericks. Brad Hanson, Layton’s uncle, said Layton’s mother, Cheri Hanson, was initially told by hospital staﬀ that her son had not been tasered. He doesn’t know if hospital staﬀ members assumed Layton hadn’t been tasered or if they received that information from police. “We just learned there’s some discrepancies between the police report and the BCA investigation,” Brad Hanson said. “At ﬁrst they didn’t say there was a taser. Now they’re saying a taser was used. We’re getting that from the bureau.” The initial Department of Public Safety news release also said an ambulance responded to Hy-Vee and Layton was taken to the Blue Earth County Jail in the ambulance. Layton’s family also had questions about why, if an ambulance was necessary, Layton was taken to jail and not the hospital. Layton’s heart stopped at some point on his way to the jail and he wasn’t taken to the hospital until after he was revived. When Hentges was asked those questions, he provided some answers by forwarding an email to The Free Press that was sent to him by Todd Miller, director of Public Safety. The email said Layton “immediately became combative” and fought “violently” with the ﬁrst oﬃcer who arrived at the scene. It also conﬁrmed a tasing device had been used on Layton. “The oﬃcer called for assistance and additional oﬃcers and a commander responded to the scene,” Miller’s email said. “During the struggle, the individual did not respond to oﬃcer’s (sic) repeated commands and subsequently was tased twice in an eﬀort to control him.” 3/24/2021 North Mankato man tasered by police before death, Mankato city ofﬁcials say | Local News | mankatofreepress.com https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/north-mankato-man-tasered-by-police-before-death-mankato-city-ofﬁcials-say/article_a7b201ba-6abe-5ed4-8fb… 3/4 Oﬃcers were able to handcuﬀ Layton and identify him as someone they had been in contact with before. A Gold Cross Ambulance crew was called because the oﬃcers were concerned about how violent he had been and suspected he had been using drugs. “An ambulance was summoned for Mr. Layton and for reasons that remain as of yet unclear, Gold Cross Ambulance personnel transported Mr. Layton, along with two Mankato police oﬃcers riding in the ambulance, to the Blue Earth County Justice Center.” An autopsy was done by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Oﬃce Jan. 6. Hanson said he was told the autopsy report has not been completed. The Jan. 1 incident isn’t the ﬁrst time Layton had been arrested. He had been charged with methamphetamine possession as recently as August and he was arrested in 2010 for assaulting a police oﬃcer during a routine traﬃc stop in Austin. Hanson said, as far as he knows, Layton had quit using drugs recently. He also said hospital staﬀ told his mother there were no drugs in Layton’s system, but there was a “little bit” of alcohol. The family has been able to ﬁgure out where Layton was up until about two hours before the Hy- Vee incident.

By Matt McKinney (https://www.startribune.com/matt-mckinney/6370539/) Star Tribune MARCH 5, 2015 — 10:42AM ST. CLOUD – In the moments before he was captured, Brian G. Fitch sounded like a man on the run, two people who know him testified Monday. Accused of gunning down Mendota Heights police officer Scott Patrick on July 30 during a routine traffic stop, Fitch showed up unexpectedly at a house in Sycamore Street in St. Paul’s North End neighborhood a few hours after Patrick’s death, said Jeffrey Klink, an associate. Authorities by then had narrowed their suspect search to Fitch and were desperately combing the Twin Cities in a massive manhunt involving more than a dozen law enforcement agencies. Fitch seemed “a little out of it, like something had happened,” Klink testified Monday. Fitch told one man to tell others that he had gone to Canada, but made plans to drive to a cabin in Luck, Wis., according to Monday’s testimony. Two people said he carried a black handgun with a laser sight similar to the firearm authorities believe was used to kill Patrick. Thirteen people in all testified Monday, including police officers who engaged in a close- quarters shootout with Fitch when they found him near the Sycamore Street house. Fitch was shot eight times before his arrest. Standing on his own in court, he appears to have fully recovered from his injuries. Several police officers and one civilian witness testified that they saw at least two muzzle flashes inside Fitch’s vehicle as he shot at police; the civilian said he also saw four or five shots fired at police through Fitch’s driver’s side window. A woman testified that she drove around the Twin Cities for several hours with Fitch that afternoon, doing errands at Walgreens, stopping at a Dairy Queen and having a tire changed on their vehicle. It wasn’t until that evening that Fitch and the woman, Kelly Hardy, appeared at the Sycamore Street house driving a blue Hyundai Veracruz. Fitch was “really calm,” said Jacob Hayes in court Monday, but he wanted Hayes to tell people that he had gone to Canada. He then threatened to kill Hayes’ family if Hayes revealed Fitch’s whereabouts to anyone. Defense attorney Lauri Traub asked Hayes, an admitted meth user, why he didn’t tell authorities about the threats when he spoke to police on July 30. “Didn’t think it was a big deal,” Hayes said in court. Klink said Fitch walked in the door and asked “Who’s here? Don’t let anybody in,” before telling him to turn off his phone. Klink said he heard Fitch making plans with another man to go to the cabin in Luck. When asked if Fitch talked about the cop who had been shot that day, Klink told prosecutor Richard Dusterhoft that it was his “understanding that he [Fitch] did it. I felt it,” Klink said. Under cross-examination, Klink admitted to defense attorney Traub that he was high that day. “Are you high right now?” Traub asked. Klink said no, saying he last smoked meth about a week ago.

Dylan Flenniken spotted the Veracruz parked outside. Flenniken testified Monday that he was among the scores of officers searching for Fitch that day, and a street contact steered Flenniken and three other officers to the Sycamore Street house. They immediately radioed for more police officers but Fitch and several other people walked out of the house and began to drive off, sparking a brief chase through the neighborhood. Hayes and Hardy were both in the SUV with Fitch as he attempted to elude the growing number of unmarked police vehicles swarming the neighborhood. Fitch took a route that steered him back to Sycamore Street, and he ended up driving over a curb and into a commercial parking lot near 60 Sycamore Street. Hayes opened the front passenger door and ran from the vehicle with his hands up; he said he dropped to the ground nearby. St. Paul police officer Tim Bohn rushed toward the SUV and spotted Fitch through the open passenger door. He testified that he saw a black object in Fitch’s hand, heard two gun shots and saw two muzzle flashes before returning fire. Sgt. Greg Gravesen of the St. Paul Police Department testified that after Fitch was captured, he used a surveying instrument known as a self-registering tachometer to measure the distances between Fitch’s vehicle, the police vehicles, and the spots where police officers were standing when they fired toward Fitch. The analysis showed that officer Tim Bohn was just 16 feet away from Fitch when the two of them opened fire on each other. Bohn wasn’t hit, but said he saw two muzzle flashes from Fitch’s gun and considered himself the target. He fired several times at Fitch, then ran around the front of the vehicle and fired through the windshield as Fitch backed away. “Did you think you were going to die?” asked Dusterhoft. “Yes,” said Bohn. Testimony resumes Tuesday morning.   Matt McKinney is a reporter on the Star Tribune's state team.

January 4, 2011 9:00 a.m. Matt Bostrom is the new Ramsey County sheriff. MPR Photo/Tim Nelson At the Ramsey County Jail near downtown St. Paul, the guard really is changing. Former St. Paul Police Assistant Chief Matt Bostrom was sworn in as sheriff Tuesday, succeeding four-term incumbent Bob Fletcher. Both are long time fixtures in law enforcement in the East Metro. They were actually partners as the lead local police officials during the Republican National Convention in 2008, but they could hardly be more different. \"I'm okay with being out of the headlines,\" Bostrom said. He's 49 and has been a cop -- like his dad before him -- for more than 28 years. He's known as a low-key, behind-the-scenes administrator. \"The primary principles of what I'm about and what I believe makes great law enforcement is first and foremost making sure that you provide great community policing services,\" he said. \"When you don't prescribe to a neighborhood how they can be safe. You work with them and you take that same principle and you work with law enforcement leaders throughout the region.\" It's a sharp contrast to Bob Fletcher, the man he's succeeding. Fletcher once ran for mayor in St. Paul and campaigned to repeal the city's gay rights ordinance. He brought that same high profile to the sheriff's office in 1995. He made headlines taking preemptive security measures at the Ramsey County Courthouse during the Sept. 11 attacks, and then launched his own weapons of mass destruction squad. In later years, he spearheaded a secret investigation into groups likely to demonstrate at the Republican National Convention, and sent his troops onto the freeways to crack down on texting drivers. But Fletcher drew criticism from state and local law enforcement, and scandal tinged his tenure, as well. Two of his ranking employees were convicted on federal corruption charges. A gang unit Fletcher helped found was shut down amid more corruption allegations. At one point, he was forced to order his own son arrested on a drug charge. Fletcher declined repeated requests for interviews on his 16-year tenure. He has returned to work as a ranking officer with the St. Paul police department where he worked before his first election. Bostrom was Fletcher's fourth opponent and the first successful one. Bostrom pledged during his campaign to clean up the department and live within its financial means. Fletcher battled the Ramsey County Board on finances regularly, and reported a quarter-million-dollar budget gap late last month. \"Along the campaign trail, I mentioned that I am going to hold the line on the budget for two years, and that's what I'm going to do. I think its going to take several months to do a complete audit, and then let's run that for a few quarters,\" Bostrom said. But money won't be Bostrom's only concern. The jail he's in charge of has been the focus of repeated criticism for inmate deaths. They include the suicide of a Villanova history professor in 2003 and a triple 3/20/2021 Bostrom succeeds Fletcher as Ramsey County sheriff | MPR News https://www.mprnews.org/story/2011/01/04/matt-bostrom-bob-ﬂetcher-ramsey-county-sheriff 2/2 murder suspect in August, as well medical-related deaths of prisoners in 2006 and 2007. Bostrom says suicides are difficult to prevent, but he's ready to make changes. \"One of the first orders of business for me is to look at how we're leading in that area, how we're selecting staff and then, what are expecations?\" he said. \"What are the practices and policies that we provide for our staff there? And at the same time, are there improvements we need to further make that facility safe?\" Bostrom officially took over the office on Monday. His 500-person department covers about 500,000 residents. Bostrom's deputies also serve as the police departments for seven St. Paul suburbs including Shoreview, Arden Hills, and North Oaks. Gallery Your support matters. You make MPR News possible.

PAUL Mom feared tragic end for son shot by St. Paul police A mother feared a tragic end for her only son, who was fatally shot at a motel Monday night by St. Paul police.  By Chao Xiong (https://www.startribune.com/chao-xiong/10646266/) Star Tribune JULY 20, 2010 — 9:33PM Despite the time and hope that John Charles Carr's mother invested in helping him fight his meth addiction, deep in her heart she knew her only son would meet a tragic end. When police arrived on her Amery, Wis., doorstep Monday night to tell her that Carr had been shot by St. Paul police after allegedly confronting them in a motel with two large knives, she was grateful that no one else was harmed. \"I guess I've always known that this was probably how it was going to end,\" his mother, Linda Menge, said in a weary voice Tuesday evening. \"I always felt that he was in pain. At this point, I feel that he's out of that now.\" Carr, 36, died after being shot multiple times about 7:30 p.m. in the Super 8 Motel at 1739 Old Hudson Road. Police spokesman Sgt. Pete Crum said callers dialed 911 to report that Carr was suicidal, armed with knives and possibly high on meth. Police would not say what may have led to Carr's mental state Monday, but court documents, his mother and his stepfather paint a picture of a man tortured by addiction, violence and mental health problems. Linda and Mitch Menge, said Carr started using meth when he was about 20. He dipped in and out of the addiction, and his behavior reflected it. 'He wasn't always on drugs' When he wasn't using, his parents said, he was a well-liked guy who worked and who loved to fish, camp and take his two children to waterparks. \"He was great with his kids,\" said Mitch Menge. \"He wasn't always on drugs.\" But Carr's life also took dark turns. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to felony second-degree assault for a violent attack on his then-wife that left her bruised over her upper torso. According to a criminal complaint filed in Ramsey County District Court, Carr punched and kicked his wife repeatedly, choked her and struck her with a metal shower curtain rod, bending it. Carr told police that he was bipolar, paranoid-schizophrenic and manic-depressive, taking several medications for the conditions, according to the complaint. That same year, his sister-in-law petitioned for custody of his daughter, now 11, citing her parents' inability to care for her, including Carr's drug use and commitment to a psychiatric hospital in St. Peter, Minn. He also had convictions for drunken driving and possession of a controlled substance. When officers knocked on Carr's third-floor motel room door Monday evening, he allegedly yelled through the door with threats to kill them. Police were evacuating nearby occupants when Carr came out and confronted four police officers in the hallway with a large utility knife in each hand. He was shot and died at the scene. Carr confronted the officers in \"close proximity\" and words were exchanged, Crum said. It's unclear how many times he was shot and by how many officers. Autopsy results are pending. He seemed fine a month ago FEED LOADER – STAR TRIBUNE John C. Carr 4/24/2021 Mom feared tragic end for son shot by St. Paul police - StarTribune.com https://www.startribune.com/mom-feared-tragic-end-for-son-shot-by-st-paul-police/98888659/ 2/2 Carr's parents don't know what may have pushed him over the edge. His mother, who sent him to multiple rehabilitation centers, said he seemed fine the last time she saw him about a month ago.

Carr, who had lived in Anoka, graduated from Tartan High School in 1992. \"The dude always had a smile on his face and was always laughing,\" said Shane Patten, a school friend. \"That's how I remember him.\" Carr's romantic ups and downs are chronicled on his girlfriend's Facebook profile, which shows fluctuations from \"in a relationship\" to \"it's complicated\" to \"in a relationship,\" but his parents were unsure if that played a role Monday. The four officers -- Colby Bragg, Arnulfo Curiel, Joshua Raichert and Justin Rangel -- are on paid administrative leave, which is standard practice. The incident will be investigated and presented to the Ramsey County attorney's office for consideration by a grand jury, which is also standard procedure.

PAUL SERGEANT FIRED FOR DRUG USE    A highly regarded St.  Paul police investigator who was fired in February for using marijuana will reclaim his job.    An arbitrator reinstated Sgt.  Cregg Brackman, named the state's top sex-crime investigator in 1997, to the Police Department, Chief William Finney said Tuesday.  The arbitrator disallowed the firing because the department didn't have a zero-tolerance policy on drug use, he said.    The arbitrator ruled that Brackman should serve a 30-day unpaid suspension and will be subject to random drug tests for the remainder of his career, Finney said.  Brackman will return to work as soon as possible, but he will be assigned to a different unit, Finney said.

      "3/18/2021 Minneapolis ofﬁcer ordered back on the job after ﬁring for punching handcuffed man | MPR News https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/12/02/minneapolis-ofﬁcer-ordered-back-on-the-job-after-ﬁring-for-punching-handcuffed-man 1/2 Crime, Law and Justice Minneapolis o¨cer ordered back on the job after ¦ring for punching handcuffed man Brandt Williams Minneapolis December 2, 2019 10:08 p.m. Minneapolis police in October 2015. Courtesy of Minneapolis Police Department 2015 A Minneapolis police officer who was fired after he punched a handcuffed man in his face several times has been given his job back. Officer Peter Brazeau was fired earlier this year for using excessive force. But an arbitrator, citing mitigating factors, reduced Brazeau’s termination to an 80-hour suspension without pay. In December 2016, officers Brazeau and Alexander Brown struggled with a man in downtown Minneapolis. According to the arbitrator’s report, the officers were trying to put the unnamed man in “protective custody” and take him to the hospital. Brazeau told his supervisor that the man was intoxicated and trying to “start fights with people.” At first, the man was cooperative, said Brazeau. But the man became combative once he was in cuffs. The report says Brazeau told supervisors that as the man was cuffed and on his back, he kicked Brazeau in the chest, knocking the wind out of the officer and the body-worn camera off his uniform. “Then, I placed my knee on his chest and delivered three to four strikes to his face,” said Brazeau. Officer Brown also struck the man in his face while the two tried to get him under control, reads the report. The report says medical responders administered ketamine, a powerful sedative, to calm the man down. The use of the drug by medical responders on people in police custody would later spark controversy. In a 2018 study, the city’s police conduct review office found eight instances in which officers gave an opinion or asked EMS employees to inject ketamine into people. The man was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and a broken nose, but he left before being discharged. The report says doctors were not able to determine “or suggest” how the man received the injuries. Brazeau had reported that the man had blood on his face and hands before he and his partner took the man into custody. According to the report, Chief Medaria Arradondo sacked Brazeau telling him in a departmental communication, “your actions were unwarranted and unacceptable.” Labor arbitrator Sherwood Malamud found the termination to be excessive punishment for an officer given multiple departmental awards. Malamud added that Brazeau’s work in the First Precinct “at a job performance level of exceeds expectations, serves as mitigating factors which make the imposition of the discharge penalty inappropriate.” State law allows Brazeau to challenge a termination through a “veteran’s preference” process. He received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps after twice being deployed to serve in Iraq. He joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2013. Malamud also directed the Minneapolis police department to retrain Brazeau on a few different aspects of handcuffing, including “how to address continued resistance by a handcuffed individual due to their level of intoxication or mental impairment.” Police spokesperson John Elder said Brazeau is not yet back on the job. 3/18/2021 Minneapolis ofﬁcer ordered back on the job after ﬁring for punching handcuffed man | MPR News https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/12/02/minneapolis-ofﬁcer-ordered-back-on-the-job-after-ﬁring-for-punching-handcuffed-man 2/2 Your support matters.

Sam Harper for MPR News The trial of a St. Paul police officer charged with violating a man's civil rights began in federal court Wednesday. In 2016, officer Brett Palkowitsch repeatedly kicked Frank Baker while Baker was being bitten by a police dog. Federal prosecutors say Palkowitsch used excessive force. Palkowitsch has pleaded not guilty. He is on paid administrative leave. In opening statements, prosecutors said after Palkowitsch kicked Baker, breaking several ribs and collapsing his lungs, Palkowitsch bragged about it. They said he texted a picture of Baker in the hospital to another officer. They also said Palkowitsch ignored his training, which instructed officers to not use force when a K-9 is biting someone. Yet in her opening statement, defense attorney Deborah Ellis said Palkowitsch actually saved Baker from possibly losing his leg by stepping in when the K- 9 handler failed to take control of the situation. She said Palkowitsch focused his attention on Baker’s hands moving towards his midsection, fearing he had a gun. No gun was found. Former St. Paul police officer Joseph Dick, who now works for the FBI, testified that he believed Frank Baker, 53, in the o¨ces of his attorney in 2017.  Tim Nelson | MPR News Palkowitsch was an officer who often escalated situations that did not need to be escalated. He said he wished that he had told Palkowitsch to back off the night of June 24, 2016. Police were responding to a report of a fight, and told that a man with dreadlocks and a white T-shirt was in the area and had a gun. Baker, who wore his hair like that at the time, was in a Jeep nearby talking on his cellphone when police ordered him to get out with his hands up. A police car dash camera shows a police dog dragging Baker to the ground, as Baker screams in pain. At the same time, officers are shouting commands at Baker to turn over and put his hands out. When Baker was not complying, an officer, later identified as Palkowitsch, can be seen delivering three kicks to Baker. SPPD Sgt. Jason Brodt, who trains K-9 officers, testified that officers are trained not to apply force to someone who is being bitten by a police dog. However, under cross examination, the trainer said there are exceptions. If a person being bitten by a dog pulls a gun, surrounding officers would be authorized to use force. In 2017, Baker sued the city and settled the lawsuit for $2 million — the city’s largest ever police misconduct 3/7/2021 Testimony begins in trial of St. Paul cop accused of excessive force | MPR News https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/11/13/testimony-begins-in-trial-of-st-paul-cop-accused-of-excessive-force 2/2 payout.

      "3/18/2021 Minneapolis police ofﬁcer ﬁred for punching handcuffed man sues city for job, wages - StarTribune.com https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-ofﬁcer-ﬁred-for-punching-handcuffed-man-sues-city-for-job-wages/566348652/ 1/2 MINNEAPOLIS Minneapolis police officer fired for punching handcuffed man sues city for job, wages Alexander Brown, who was ﬁred for beating a man, alleges the city backed out of an agreement to rehire him.  By Chao Xiong (https://www.startribune.com/chao-xiong/10646266/) Star Tribune DECEMBER 19, 2019 — 5:10PM A Minneapolis police officer who was fired (http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis- police-officer-fired-for-2016-beating-of-handcuffed-native-man-partner-also-faces- termination/506012022/?refresh=true) for punching a handcuffed American Indian man is suing the city, claiming that it agreed to rehire him and then backed out of the deal. Alexander Brown and the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis filed suit against the city of Minneapolis Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court. The suit alleges that after Chief Medaria Arradondo fired Brown in February, the union challenged the termination and reached a settlement agreement with the city in October. The city had agreed to rehire Brown and reimburse him for lost wages, the suit said. “Plaintiff Brown has been ready and able to work since October 31, 2019,” the suit said. “Defendant City required Plaintiff to remain at home prepared to work since October 31, 2019 …” The suit accuses the city of breach of contract, violating state law by failing to pay Brown and violating the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The city issued a statement saying the city attorney’s office hadn’t reviewed the suit, and had no comment. Brown’s suit is asking a judge to compel the city to honor the agreement, subject the city to penalties for its violations, award Brown and the union legal costs and award Brown compensatory damages in excess of $50,000, a starting amount commonly listed in civil suits. Brown’s suit included a copy of the settlement agreement reached with the city on October 31, 2019. The document said the city would agree to rehire Brown, impose an 80-hour suspension for his actions and reimburse him for lost wages. The agreement was signed by union president, Lt. Bob Kroll, and Arradondo. Brown and his former partner Peter Brazeau struck a man who kicked at them while he was handcuffed and lying on the ground in downtown Minneapolis in December 2016. Their use of force was deemed excessive by an internal review panel, which recommended that they be disciplined. They were ordered to undergo extra training, and returned to street duty for nearly a year until Arradondo fired them. The officers were cleared of criminal wrongdoing. An arbitrator ruled in October (http://www.startribune.com/firing-of-minneapolis- officer-who-struck-handcuffed-man-reduced-to-2-week-suspension/565749592/? refresh=true) that Brazeau could have his job back. The decision found that he violated the department’s policy on excessive force and should serve an 80-hour suspension without pay.

By Matt McKinney (https://www.startribune.com/matt-mckinney/6370539/) and PAUL Walsh AUGUST 9, 2011 — 9:59PM A man suspected of shooting someone at a south Minneapolis public housing complex Monday night was confronted and shot minutes later by Minneapolis police, authorities said. As he recovered from a police gunshot at Hennepin County Medical Center, Leroy Martinez, 23, of 1426 Penn Av. N., was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault in connection with a shooting near the playground of the Little Earth of United Tribes public housing complex. Like Martinez, the victim in that shooting is expected to live. The shootings took place around 11:15 p.m., when two off-duty officers working for the housing complex and three on-duty officers heard gunshots near 25th Street and Cedar Avenue S. As they responded to the gunfire, officers saw a man running. The officers ran after him. The accounts of police and an eyewitness interviewed by the Star Tribune differ on what happened next. According to police, Martinez drew his gun, refused orders to drop it and was shot by Minneapolis officer Terry Nutter. Yet Delora Iceman, who lives at Little Earth of United Tribes, said the man had thrown his gun to the ground and held his hands in the air when Nutter shot him, after the officer warned that he would do so. \"He had no reason to shoot that little boy,\" said Iceman, who said she witnessed the scene from her balcony. Minneapolis police spokesman Sgt. Bill Palmer disputed Iceman's account. \"That is not consistent with other statements ... from other independent witnesses,\" he said. Officers Steven Herron, Derek Chauvin and Brandon Brugger and Lt. Gwen Gunter were also at the scene, according to the department. Nutter, Herron, Chauvin and Brugger had been in the area tracking and arresting a fugitive on a felony warrant when they heard the gunshots. Nutter has been a police officer since 2004 and has long worked off-duty at the Little Earth of United Tribes, according to Little Earth president and CEO Bill Ziegler. \"A great officer,\" said Ziegler. \"This is one of the officers that I totally trust.\" Ziegler vouched for the officer's actions, as well, saying he spoke to witnesses who told him Martinez drew his weapon. A surveillance video of the shooting exists, according to Ziegler, but the security camera may have been partially obstructed by a tree. A copy of the video was turned over to the Police Department, he said. All of the officers were put on standard three-day administrative leave. Police and the department's internal affairs unit are conducting separate investigations. Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call police at 612-692-TIPS.

KSFY ﬁrst reported this story back in June of 2018 when he was originally arrested. The felony charge of threats of violence was dismissed as well as the two misdemeanor domestic assault charges. He was arrested on Friday, June 15th after he and his wife got into an argument and things escalated from there. According to court documents, the incident happened at the couple's home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The children left the house during the argument to call police. That's when Bruns and his wife got into another argument. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, where you could hear him unlocking a gun safe and hear his wife yelling to put the gun down because she did not want to die. His wife read a statement in the sentencing hearing on Tuesday. She released this statement to KSFY afterwards, \"I do not wish to speak to the media at this time, as I believe the recording and my statement speak for themselves. I am happy justice was served as much as it can be, and look forward to being able to sleep for the next 2 years. I hope my story will give hope to someone else living in fear at this time to come forward and seek help. And for all the women that the system has failed, I hope my story creates change.\" At the time of the arrest, Bruns was a police oﬃcer with the Adrian Police Department, but Chief Shawn Langseth told KSFY News he was placed on administrative leave indeﬁnitely.

Adrian Police Chief Shawn Langseth tells KSFY News 43-year-old Richard David Bruns is on administrative leave indeﬁnitely, effective immediately. According to court documents, the incident happened Friday night at the couple's home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The victim told authorities she had three beers and Bruns had eight. She said Bruns was allegedly \"snippy\" with her and their two children when they arrived home, and an argument started. Bruns was \"raging mad\" when he got into the house and asked his wife and 12-year-old son to ﬁght him. The son \"smarted off\" to Bruns and ran outside. Bruns followed, and his wife said she then heard a loud noise outside on the porch. Then she heard he son crying. When she ran to her son, Bruns allegedly began pushing her away with his stomach or chest. The couple's daughter then came into the room, and the victim told her to run across the street to her grandmother's house and call 911. After the children left, Bruns and his wife got into another argument about calling the police. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, according to court documents. Bruns then allegedly used keys to unlock a gun safe. His wife could be heard yelling at him to put the gun down and get it away from her on the recordning. He allegedly told her, \"Cops come knocking on my door, you’re dead,\" and that if he was going to go to jail, he was going to \"earn it.\" She pleaded with him and said she did not want to die. Bruns was then heard on the recording locking the gun safe. According to court documents, Bruns admitted to police that he and his wife had been having issues for a long time and said he had gone to far during the incident. He told police he did not think he pointed a gun at his wife. Authorities seized multiple ﬁrearms from the home, including handguns, a riﬂe and a shotgun. They also found a lock-box style gun safe with two handguns and two loaded magazines inside of it. The 12-year-old son told police that Bruns never touched him. Authorities arrested Bruns on second degree assault with a dangerous weapon, intent to terrorize and two counts of domestic assault (a misdemeanor). He was released from Nobles County Jail after posting a $100,000 bond with several conditions, including no contact with the victims. The Compass Center for victims of domestic violence in Sioux Falls says members of law enforcement are not immune from abusive relationships. \"When the perpetrator is someone in law enforcement it makes it much more difﬁcult for a survivor to tell their story,\" The Compass Center Director Michelle Markgraf said. \"The person that they report to is often the friend of the perpetrator and it is sometimes difﬁcult for them to tell their friends that this is going on.\" Markgraf said if someone is afraid to report abuse directly to law enforcement, the Compass Center can help. Give them a call at (605) 339-0116 if you are experiencing abuse or fear for the safety of you or your family.

      "The hits keep coming  Monday, February 26, 2007 at 10:59 a.m.   By G.R. Anderson Jr.   Friday's Minneapolis City Council meeting brought two different payouts over one alleged police misconduct  incident. The full council approved a $10,000 payday to Christopher D. Perry and $5,000 to his brother Mario  P. Perry, who was a juvenile when the two ran afoul of the cops on November 16, 2004.  Payouts over claims of police misconduct are nothing new in this town (see \"The Hit Parade Revisited,\" CP  7/20/2005), but this incident seemed rooted in some rather, uh, dubious behavior. According to a city attorney's  memo urging the council to approve settlement, MPD officers James Burns and Michael Geere were cruising  the north side looking for \"an identified murder suspect known to frequent\" 4050 Bryant Avenue North. The  officers found a car \"with four occupants\" illegally parked in the alley behind the address. Officer Burns  approached the car and \"smelled marijuana and saw a 'philly blunt' in the ashtray,\" according to the memo from  the city attorney's office.  From there various high jinks ensued, and accounts predictably differ, but someone on the scene was arrested  after allegedly wielding a tire iron, insults were hurled, and at some point the Perry brothers resisted arrest. One  thing all parties agree on is that force was used by the police officers. As a result, both brothers \"received  various scrapes and bruises,\" and Chris Perry suffered a broken tooth, according to the account from the city  attorney's office, which is no doubt vague on some details.  The Perry payouts are the third and fourth police-related settlements so far this year, bringing a grand total of  32,000 taxpayer dollars doled out to save the hides of the men in blue in a court of law. Though the number of  payouts hit a high in 2004, with some 24 settlements paying out more than $2 million, last year the city forked  over only $633,250 over 10 alleged MPD misconduct incidents. Still, payouts over use of force and other  allegations against the police likely won't go away soon. \"It's a total crapshoot,\" says one city hall insider.  \"There is no predictable trend year to year.\"  The Perry situation mostly went up in smoke: An obstruction charge against Chris was dismissed, and Mario  was never charged with any crime. \"This was a totally unnecessary incident, but they got hurt,\" says Al Goins,  attorney for the Perry brothers, adding that the settlement was \"small potatoes.\" \"The city got a look at these  kids, decided their records were clean and that they were going to present well in a trial, so they settled. The  main issue is whether the city is going to get serious about reigning in its department over use of force.\"\n",

By Matt McKinney (https://www.startribune.com/matt-mckinney/6370539/) and PAUL Walsh AUGUST 9, 2011 — 9:59PM A man suspected of shooting someone at a south Minneapolis public housing complex Monday night was confronted and shot minutes later by Minneapolis police, authorities said. As he recovered from a police gunshot at Hennepin County Medical Center, Leroy Martinez, 23, of 1426 Penn Av. N., was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault in connection with a shooting near the playground of the Little Earth of United Tribes public housing complex. Like Martinez, the victim in that shooting is expected to live. The shootings took place around 11:15 p.m., when two off-duty officers working for the housing complex and three on-duty officers heard gunshots near 25th Street and Cedar Avenue S. As they responded to the gunfire, officers saw a man running. The officers ran after him. The accounts of police and an eyewitness interviewed by the Star Tribune differ on what happened next. According to police, Martinez drew his gun, refused orders to drop it and was shot by Minneapolis officer Terry Nutter. Yet Delora Iceman, who lives at Little Earth of United Tribes, said the man had thrown his gun to the ground and held his hands in the air when Nutter shot him, after the officer warned that he would do so. \"He had no reason to shoot that little boy,\" said Iceman, who said she witnessed the scene from her balcony. Minneapolis police spokesman Sgt. Bill Palmer disputed Iceman\\'s account. \"That is not consistent with other statements ... from other independent witnesses,\" he said. Officers Steven Herron, Derek Chauvin and Brandon Brugger and Lt. Gwen Gunter were also at the scene, according to the department. Nutter, Herron, Chauvin and Brugger had been in the area tracking and arresting a fugitive on a felony warrant when they heard the gunshots. Nutter has been a police officer since 2004 and has long worked off-duty at the Little Earth of United Tribes, according to Little Earth president and CEO Bill Ziegler. \"A great officer,\" said Ziegler. \"This is one of the officers that I totally trust.\" Ziegler vouched for the officer\\'s actions, as well, saying he spoke to witnesses who told him Martinez drew his weapon. A surveillance video of the shooting exists, according to Ziegler, but the security camera may have been partially obstructed by a tree. A copy of the video was turned over to the Police Department, he said. All of the officers were put on standard three-day administrative leave. Police and the department\\'s internal affairs unit are conducting separate investigations. Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call police at 612-692-TIPS.

KSFY ﬁrst reported this story back in June of 2018 when he was originally arrested. The felony charge of threats of violence was dismissed as well as the two misdemeanor domestic assault charges. He was arrested on Friday, June 15th after he and his wife got into an argument and things escalated from there. According to court documents, the incident happened at the couple\\'s home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The children left the house during the argument to call police. That\\'s when Bruns and his wife got into another argument. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, where you could hear him unlocking a gun safe and hear his wife yelling to put the gun down because she did not want to die. His wife read a statement in the sentencing hearing on Tuesday. She released this statement to KSFY afterwards, \"I do not wish to speak to the media at this time, as I believe the recording and my statement speak for themselves. I am happy justice was served as much as it can be, and look forward to being able to sleep for the next 2 years. I hope my story will give hope to someone else living in fear at this time to come forward and seek help. And for all the women that the system has failed, I hope my story creates change.\" At the time of the arrest, Bruns was a police oﬃcer with the Adrian Police Department, but Chief Shawn Langseth told KSFY News he was placed on administrative leave indeﬁnitely.

Adrian Police Chief Shawn Langseth tells KSFY News 43-year-old Richard David Bruns is on administrative leave indeﬁnitely, effective immediately. According to court documents, the incident happened Friday night at the couple\\'s home in Adrian following an evening of drinking. The victim told authorities she had three beers and Bruns had eight. She said Bruns was allegedly \"snippy\" with her and their two children when they arrived home, and an argument started. Bruns was \"raging mad\" when he got into the house and asked his wife and 12-year-old son to ﬁght him. The son \"smarted off\" to Bruns and ran outside. Bruns followed, and his wife said she then heard a loud noise outside on the porch. Then she heard he son crying. When she ran to her son, Bruns allegedly began pushing her away with his stomach or chest. The couple\\'s daughter then came into the room, and the victim told her to run across the street to her grandmother\\'s house and call 911. After the children left, Bruns and his wife got into another argument about calling the police. She recorded the conversation on her cell phone, according to court documents. Bruns then allegedly used keys to unlock a gun safe. His wife could be heard yelling at him to put the gun down and get it away from her on the recordning. He allegedly told her, \"Cops come knocking on my door, you’re dead,\" and that if he was going to go to jail, he was going to \"earn it.\" She pleaded with him and said she did not want to die. Bruns was then heard on the recording locking the gun safe. According to court documents, Bruns admitted to police that he and his wife had been having issues for a long time and said he had gone to far during the incident. He told police he did not think he pointed a gun at his wife. Authorities seized multiple ﬁrearms from the home, including handguns, a riﬂe and a shotgun. They also found a lock-box style gun safe with two handguns and two loaded magazines inside of it. The 12-year-old son told police that Bruns never touched him. Authorities arrested Bruns on second degree assault with a dangerous weapon, intent to terrorize and two counts of domestic assault (a misdemeanor). He was released from Nobles County Jail after posting a $100,000 bond with several conditions, including no contact with the victims. The Compass Center for victims of domestic violence in Sioux Falls says members of law enforcement are not immune from abusive relationships. \"When the perpetrator is someone in law enforcement it makes it much more difﬁcult for a survivor to tell their story,\" The Compass Center Director Michelle Markgraf said. \"The person that they report to is often the friend of the perpetrator and it is sometimes difﬁcult for them to tell their friends that this is going on.\" Markgraf said if someone is afraid to report abuse directly to law enforcement, the Compass Center can help. Give them a call at (605) 339-0116 if you are experiencing abuse or fear for the safety of you or your family.

       " 'The hits keep coming  Monday, February 26, 2007 at 10:59 a.m.   By G.R. Anderson Jr.   Friday\\'s Minneapolis City Council meeting brought two different payouts over one alleged police misconduct  incident. The full council approved a $10,000 payday to Christopher D. Perry and $5,000 to his brother Mario  P. Perry, who was a juvenile when the two ran afoul of the cops on November 16, 2004.  Payouts over claims of police misconduct are nothing new in this town (see \"The Hit Parade Revisited,\" CP  7/20/2005), but this incident seemed rooted in some rather, uh, dubious behavior. According to a city attorney\\'s  memo urging the council to approve settlement, MPD officers James Burns and Michael Geere were cruising  the north side looking for \"an identified murder suspect known to frequent\" 4050 Bryant Avenue North. The  officers found a car \"with four occupants\" illegally parked in the alley behind the address. Officer Burns  approached the car and \"smelled marijuana and saw a \\'philly blunt\\' in the ashtray,\" according to the memo from  the city attorney\\'s office.  From there various high jinks ensued, and accounts predictably differ, but someone on the scene was arrested  after allegedly wielding a tire iron, insults were hurled, and at some point the Perry brothers resisted arrest. One  thing all parties agree on is that force was used by the police officers. As a result, both brothers \"received  various scrapes and bruises,\" and Chris Perry suffered a broken tooth, according to the account from the city  attorney\\'s office, which is no doubt vague on some details.  The Perry payouts are the third and fourth police-related settlements so far this year, bringing a grand total of  32,000 taxpayer dollars doled out to save the hides of the men in blue in a court of law. Though the number of  payouts hit a high in 2004, with some 24 settlements paying out more than $2 million, last year the city forked  over only $633,250 over 10 alleged MPD misconduct incidents. Still, payouts over use of force and other  allegations against the police likely won\\'t go away soon. \"It\\'s a total crapshoot,\" says one city hall insider.  \"There is no predictable trend year to year.\"  The Perry situation mostly went up in smoke: An obstruction charge against Chris was dismissed, and Mario  was never charged with any crime. \"This was a totally unnecessary incident, but they got hurt,\" says Al Goins,  attorney for the Perry brothers, adding that the settlement was \"small potatoes.\" \"The city got a look at these  kids, decided their records were clean and that they were going to present well in a trial, so they settled. The  main issue is whether the city is going to get serious about reigning in its department over use of force.\"',\n",

RE: Complaint of 
, ACRB File 
No. 20-066 
 
 
Dear Chief Bryant: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) 
has concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 alleging that on September 12, 2020, while he was waiting to 
park his vehicle in front of the Red Martini Restaurant and Lounge, Atlanta 
Police Officer James Gikanga (Unique ID No. 7013): (1) unlawfully detained 
him and (2) falsely arrested him for Laying Drag and Reckless Driving.  
 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of False Imprisonment related to the unlawful 
detainment claim be assigned a finding of “Exonerated”.  
2. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
false arrest claim be assigned a finding of “Not Sustained”. 
3. Officer Gikanga failed to advise 
 the reason for the 
traffic stop when he approached his vehicle, as per 
APD.SOP.4010, Section 4.5.1(10), and assigned finding of 
“Sustained”, the Board recommends, as penalty, an Oral 
Admonishment and Training on How to Properly Conduct 
Traffic Stops. 
 
 
The Board further recommends that the APD remind its officers of the 
traffic stop procedures, particularly, advising citizens of the reason(s) for the 
stop at the outset of the stop, unless there are extenuating circumstances.

Dear Ms. Tracee McDaniel: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board’s letter regarding the complaint of 
 the alleged actions 
of Atlanta Police Officer Rafael Cruz on December 13, 2020, and the Board’s determination. This letter serves, in accordance 
with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police 
investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards completed a preliminary investigation into the incident 
prior to receiving the Board’s determination letter. The preliminary investigation revealed that on December 13, 2020, 
Officer Cruz responded to a 911 call placed by the complainant. The complainant informed Officer Cruz of some concerns 
that she had regarding her roommate which Officer Cruz advised her were civil in nature.  A review of the Body-Worn 
Camera (BWC) footage does not suggest that Officer Cruz behaved in an unprofessional manner during his interactions with 
Ms. Njoku.  
 
During the complainant’s conversation with Officer Cruz, she informed him that she had PTSD and had been assaulted and 
sexually assaulted on numerous occasions. Officer Cruz completed a police report documenting the complainant’s concerns 
and indicated that the complainant was a “Rape Victim” in the report. While rape is a type of sexual assault, the term does not 
encompass all nonconsensual sexual acts. A request will be sent to Officer Cruz’s supervisor to review the importance of 
terminology choices and accuracy when completing incident reports.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the concerns of 
the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.

Dear Ms. Tracee McDaniel: 
 
I am in receipt of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board’s letter regarding the complaint of 
 the alleged 
actions of Atlanta Police Officer Cadell Stevens and Sergeant Kimberly Collins on February 5, 2021, and the 
Board’s determination. This letter serves, in accordance with Sec. 2-2213 of the City of Atlanta Code of 
Ordinances, as a delineation of action taken with respect to the Atlanta Police investigation of the event.  
 
The Atlanta Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards completed a preliminary investigation into the 
incident prior to receiving the Board’s determination letter. Similar to the findings of the Board, the Office of 
Professional Standards did not find any evidence to suggest that Officer Stevens nor Sergeant Collins violated any 
departmental policies or procedures.   
 
I appreciate the opportunity to correspond with the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, and to be made aware of the 
concerns of the Board. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any future questions.  
 
 
Sincerely,

INVESTIGATOR TONYA L. RICHARDSON
Allegations:
The male Complainant alleged that on February 13, 2021, Atlanta
Police Officer Danny Padron conducted an unlawful traffic stop and
issued him an inaccurate citation.
Staff Recommendations:
Allegation of False Imprisonment
Issue: The Complainant’s allegation that Officer Padron conducted
an unlawful traffic stop.
Based on the evidence obtained during the investigation, the ACRB
staff recommends that the allegation of False Imprisonment against
Officer Danny Padron be assigned a finding of “Not Sustained” (the
investigation failed to prove or disprove that the alleged acts
occurred).
Allegation of Violation of Department Standard Operating
Procedures
Issue: The Complainant’s allegation that Officer Padron completed
an inaccurate traffic citation.
Based on the evidence obtained during the investigation, the ACRB
recommends that the allegation of Violation of Department
Standard Operating Procedures, specifically APD.SOP.2010, Section
4.2.21, against Officer Danny Padron be assigned a finding of
“Sustained” (the investigation established by a preponderance of
the evidence that the officer committed the alleged act(s) of
misconduct). 
According to the officer’s OPS disciplinary history & APD’s
disciplinary grid this allegation is a Cat-A violation, because the
officer has no similar or same sustained complaints within the (1)
year reckoning period. The penalty range would be an Oral
Admonishment or a Written Reprimand.
The Board could also recommend Proactive Corrective Action such
as:
Training
Counseling

RE: 
Complaint of 
, ACRB File No. 
21-041 
 
Dear Chief Bryant: 
 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by 
 
alleging that on April 9, 2021, Officers Melina Lim (Unique ID No. 7421) and 
Adrian Pitts (Unique ID No. 5678) failed to conduct an adequate investigation 
when they responded to his 9-1-1 call. He further alleged that Officer Pitts spoke 
to him in a condescending manner.  
 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Appropriate Action Required related to the 
inadequate investigation claim against Officers Lim and Pitts be 
assigned a finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, 
an Oral Admonishment for both officers. 
2. The allegation of Conduct related to the condescending claim 
against Officer Pitts be assigned a finding of “Sustained” and 
recommends, as penalty, an Oral Admonishment and Training 
on Community Oriented Policing. 
3. The investigation determined that Officer Lim, who was assigned 
as the primary officer for this incident, failed to document 
 
’s report of attempted assault as per APD.SOP.3060, Section 
4.1.6(1).  Therefore, the Board found Officer Lim in Violation of 
Department Standard Operating Procedures and assigned a 
finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a Written 
Reprimand.

RE: Complaint of Shereka McKiblins, ACRB File 
No. 21-097 
 
Dear Interim Chief Schierbaum: 
 
Please be advised that the Atlanta Citizen Review Board (“ACRB”) has 
concluded its investigation and adjudication of the complaint filed by Shereka 
McKiblins alleging that on August 16, 2021, Investigator Jorge Santa (Unique ID 
No. 4425) and Officer Reagan Smith (Unique ID No. 7450) exhibited 
unprofessional conduct in that they were rude to her when they refused to answer 
questions regarding her 16-year-old son’s arrest.  Ms. McKiblins further alleged 
that Investigator Santa abused his authority when he inappropriately told her son, 
“Watch out because we are going to kick your door in at 3:00 a.m.”, and 
repeatedly called her son a criminal.  
 
 
 
The Board determined the following: 
 
1. The allegation of Conduct against Investigator Santa and Officer 
Smith be assigned a finding of “Unfounded”. 
2. The allegation of Abuse of Authority against Investigator Santa be
assigned a finding of “Sustained” and recommends, as penalty, a
Written Reprimand and Training on the Atlanta Police
Department’s Standard Operating Procedures governing Abuse
of Authority as it relates to handling of juveniles.

  RE: Important Message Concerning Email 

  This is a reminder that email privileges are governed by the City of Minneapolis Electronic Communication Policy. The Policy is 
  located on the Intranet at:                                                        electronic-communications-policy. Electronic 
  communications are public data and must reflect a positive, professional image of the City of Minneapolis. 

  The policy covers all electronic communications, including the City's email, and internal and external websites. Every person who 
  was given or has gained access to the City's computer system is responsible for adhering to City standards when electronic 
  communications are sent, received, forwarded, saved or otherwise disseminated. Anyone who uses this system in a manner that is 
  not consistent with City policies may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

  Employees are prohibited from intentionally viewing, sending or disseminating inappropriate email materials, Including harassing, 
  threatening or obscene materials (any materials with ANY sexual connotation). You are encouraged to advise anyone who sends of 
  disseminates such inappropriate materials to stop from doing so. If you view such materials or receive such materials from a City 
  employee, vendor, volunteer or other agent of the City, report it to your immediate supervisor, the Human Resources Generalist, or 
 the Minneapolis Police Department's Internal Affair Unit. Do not delete the information from your computer until appropriate 
 authorities have had an opportunity to retrieve the information for their investigation. Employee email and/or electronic files may 
 be audited in an attempt to determine if the policy is being violated. 
                                                                                      Sincerely,

                                                                            Date 1-15-14 
 THIS AGREEMENT, entered into this     6th     day of January          20 [X] by and between the

 called Community Service Officer (CSO)). 

 WHEREAS, the City is in need of Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) Board certified people to 
 become police officers in the City of Minneapolis Police Department; 

 WHEREAS, the City is willing to assist people to become POST Board certified and to become police 
 officers in the Minneapolis Police Department by assisting them in developing skills to become police 
 officers, while they are performing CSO duties and providing education and training to interested and 
 qualified candidates; and 

 WHEREAS, the City is willing to provide tuition to candidates for CSO for the costs of the education and 
 training if the candidates, after being hired as Minneapolis CSO remain with the City for the duration of 
 the CSO program and work as police officers for an additional two years after becoming a Police Officer, 

 NOW, THEREFORE, the City and the undersigned do mutually agree as follows: 

 1.      The fair and reasonable cost and market value of the tultion portion of the POST training 
         education and training program is $12,000.00 
 2.     The City agrees to lend up to $12,000.00 to the CSO to cover the costs of tuition. The CSO 
        agrees to borrow up to $12,000.00 from the City to pay for the costs of tuition. 
 3.     For every month of full time service as a Minneapolis police officer that the employee works, the 
        $12,000,00 loan shall be reduced by $500.00, For CSOs requiring less than one year of POST 
        training and education, the repayment loan shall reflect the actual tuition amount, but not lower 
        than $3,000. For CSOs hired with their 2-year law enforcement degree, a separate Loan 
        Agreement is required. At the end of the two full years of service working as a Minneapolis Police 
         Officer, the entire $12,000.00 loan (or actual loan amount) shall be considered satisfied and paid 
        in full. However, if the CSO voluntarily separates from the Minneapolis Police Department prior to 
        working two full years as a police officer, the CSO shall immediately pay to the City the entire 
        balance owing on the loan. 
 4.     If the undersigned CSO does not return equipment, the cost of the equipment will be taken from 
        the undersigned's last check and/or legal action taken against the undersigned. 
 5,     Any CSO or police officer who is released from probation, involuntarily terminated or resigns in 
        lieu of termination from the program or from employment may by the Minneapolis Police 
        Department be excused from repayment of any outstanding loan balance. 
 6.     CSO agrees that as soon as the Police Community Service Officer program has been completed 
        the CSO will complete the testing process required for the position of police officer and advance 
        to the position of police officer for the City at the next available opportunity. CSO agrees that 
        CSO will continue with the City in the capacity of CSO from the completion of the CSO program 
        until the CSO begins employment as a police officer recruit.

     TYPE COMMENTS HERE. 
     On 06/02/2016 at approximately 1703 hours, Squad 422, Officer Robert Lewis and Officer 
     Zerrick Fuller, were dispatched to a person with a weapon. The owner of Silver Clips Hair 
     Salon called 911 because a male had come in to her business and pulled a knife on her, The 
     suspect had then left the business, got in to his vehicle, and fled in an unknown direction. Squad 
     414, Officer Aaron Pearson and Officer Zakari Ketchmark had just been to this business to take 
     a report on the same suspect. At that time the suspect had pulled a knife on the business owner 
     as well. When Squad 422 arrived the business owner was so afraid of the suspect that she 
     decided to close down her business and go home, She requested the Officers escort her to her 
     vehicle and the Officers agreed. 

     Ax the Officers were waiting for her to lock up her business, they saw the suspect in his vehicle 
     at Glenwood Av N and Humboldt Av N. Squad 414 was also on scene and went to the suspect's 
     location to detain him. Squad 422 also went to the suspect's location. The suspect got out of his 
[ ] vehicle with a wrench in one hand. Officer Pearson, Officer Fuller, and Officer Ketchmark 
     ordered the suspect to drop the wrench at gunpoint. The suspect reached into his back pocket 
     with his free hand and pulled out a knife. He opened the knife and pointed it at Officers. The 
    suspect then lunged at the Officers with the knife. At this time, Officer Lewis yelled to the other 
    three Officers that he had his Taser out. 

     Officers continued to yell for the suspect to drop the knife. The suspect screamed that he would 
     not put the knife down. The suspect began to walk backwards eastbound down the middle of 
     Glenwood Av N. At this time of day there was a steady stream of traffic from downtown with 
    people getting off of work. Officers followed the suspect, continually telling him to put the 
    knife down. The suspect then noticed that Officer Lewis had his Taser pointed at him and began 
    threatening Officer Lewis. The suspect yelled at Officer Lewis that if he tased him, he would 
    remember Officer Lewis and find him. 

     MP-1600 (Rev. 12/08) 

                                                                                                                                  1519063 
<<<

     The suspect then turned and began walking quickly eastbound in the middle of Glenwood Av N. 
     Officer Lewis ran towards the suspect with the other Officers following. The suspect must have 
     heard them approaching because he turned around and lunged at the Officers with the knife 
     again. Officer Lewis then tased the suspect, While the suspect was under power, Officer 
     Ketchmark ran up to the suspect and kicked the knife out of the suspect's hand. Officer Fuller 
     rolled the suspect over and handcuffed him. Officer Pearson kept lethal cover on the suspect. 
     The suspect was then taken into custody and no longer a threat to the Officers or the public. 

     All four Officers on scene showed great restraint with the suspect. Without the calm and level 
     headedness of the Officers, the suspect very easily could have hurt one of them or one of the 
     many people that were in the area. Officers displayed a level of professionalism and bravery that 
     is indicative of the Minneapolis Police Department. 

     It is very possible that if these Officers did not take quick action the suspect may have followed 
     through with his threats to the business owner. The suspect was high on PCP and was not 
     rational which made reasoning with him that much harder. 

     So for these reasons, I am nominated           13.43 - Personnel Data 
     Aaron Pearson                               for the Award of Valor. 

     Additional Comments by Inspector Kjos: 

     As Officer Pearson's Commanding Officer I believe his actions warrant the Medal of 
     Commendation, which is characterized by an obvious act of self-sacrifice while in the face of 
     personal danger. 

     Award Criteria included: 

    Medal of Commendation: Medal of Commendation may be awarded to a member of the 
    department for an outstanding police act which brings credit to the department, and is highly 
    recognized by other officers or citizens. This act is characterized by obvious self sacrifice while 
    in the face of personal danger.

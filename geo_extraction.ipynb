      "This is a court opinion dismissing a lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, Jenson, against several defendants, including Craft. The lawsuit alleged various claims under federal and state law, including violations of the Fourth Amendment (Miranda rights), due process, and equal protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit was based on several grounds:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lack of jurisdiction**: The court held that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims because they were inextricably intertwined with his state court conviction.\n",
      "2. **Collateral estoppel**: The court found that the plaintiff's claims were barred by collateral estoppel, as he had previously waived any constitutional challenges to the August 25, 1999, interview in the state criminal proceeding.\n",
      "3. **Heck doctrine**: The court held that the plaintiff's claims under ยง 1983 were precluded by the Supreme Court's holding in Heck v. Humphrey, which requires a conviction or sentence to be overturned before a claim can be brought under ยง 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court also dismissed the plaintiff's state law claims without prejudice because it no longer had jurisdiction over them after dismissing the federal claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key takeaways from this opinion:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A court may dismiss a lawsuit if it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n",
      "* Collateral estoppel can bar subsequent litigation of issues that were previously decided in a prior adjudication.\n",
      "* The Heck doctrine requires a conviction or sentence to be overturned before a claim can be brought under ยง 1983.\n",
      "\n",

      "This is a report and recommendation from a Magistrate Judge in a federal court case, specifically addressing two motions to suppress evidence filed by the defendant. The report concludes that both motions should be denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Motion to Suppress Statements**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The defendant argues that his statements were obtained as a result of an illegal investigatory stop.\n",
      "* The Magistrate Judge finds that the investigatory stop was proper under the Fourth Amendment, citing case law and reasoning that the defendant's conduct (walking up to a car surrounded by police officers and attempting to get in) provided reasonable suspicion for the stop.\n",
      "* Since the stop was lawful, there is no basis to suppress the statements obtained as a result of the stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of Search and Seizure**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The defendant argues that evidence obtained during the search and seizure should be suppressed because the investigatory stop was unlawful.\n",
      "* The Magistrate Judge again finds that the investigatory stop was proper, citing the same reasoning as above.\n",
      "* Since the stop was lawful, there is no basis to suppress the evidence obtained during the search and seizure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report recommends denying both motions to suppress.\n",

      "This appears to be a lengthy and detailed document related to a grievance filed by Mathew Aish, a police officer with the Columbia Heights Police Department, regarding his termination from the department.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document outlines several key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Termination for alleged dishonesty**: Aish was terminated from the department due to allegations of dishonesty related to his documentation of a high-speed pursuit on October 27, 2019.\n",
      "2. **Pursuit policy interpretation**: The Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy defines a pursuit as an attempt to stop another vehicle by a police vehicle when emergency lights and sirens are activated, and the subject vehicle fails to stop as required by law.\n",
      "3. **Expert testimony**: Peter Dahl, an expert in law enforcement and driving involving pursuits, testified that Aish did not participate in a pursuit under the Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy. Dahl explained that the third element of the policy, \"fails to stop as required by law,\" was not met because the suspect never acknowledged the officers' presence or attempted to elude them.\n",
      "4. **Union's argument**: The union argues that the employer has failed to approach the case with objectivity and instead has viewed Aish's actions through a lens of predisposition, labeling any honest explainable mistakes as dishonesty worthy of termination.\n",
      "5. **Aish's background**: Aish has over 20 years of experience in law enforcement and was previously disciplined for his dishonesty in 2006. He has since learned from his mistake and has been open about it with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document raises several questions, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Was Aish's documentation of the pursuit accurate or did he intentionally misrepresent the events?\n",
      "* Did Aish participate in a pursuit under the Columbia Heights Pursuit Policy?\n",
      "* Is the employer's interpretation of the policy reasonable, or is it overly broad?\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a more detailed analysis, I would need to review the entire document and consider the context of the case. However, based on this summary, it appears that there are valid arguments on both sides, and a thorough examination of the evidence and expert testimony is necessary to determine the outcome of Aish's grievance.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Case Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involves a lawsuit filed by Amy Elizabeth Krekelberg against the City of Minneapolis and two police officers, Heather Young and Matthew Olson, alleging violations of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA). The DPPA prohibits law enforcement agencies from accessing personal information in driver records for non-law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trial**\n",
      "\n",
      "During trial, the court instructed the jury that any access by a Minneapolis law enforcement officer to DVS records for non-law enforcement purposes was a violation of the DPPA. The jury found in favor of Krekelberg and awarded her $1 million in damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Trial Motions**\n",
      "\n",
      "The defendants filed several post-trial motions, including motions for judgment as a matter of law, for a new trial, to alter/amend/correct judgment, and to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court granted some of these motions but denied others.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Attorneys' Fees**\n",
      "\n",
      "Krekelberg's attorneys requested $644,599.13 in attorneys' fees and $47,086.36 in costs. The court awarded these amounts, finding that they were reasonable and necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Equitable Relief**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court granted Krekelberg's motion for equitable relief, ordering the City of Minneapolis to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Revise its policies to prohibit access to DVS records for non-law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "2. Conduct a review of all personnel who accessed DVS records during the relevant time period.\n",
      "3. Provide training to all law enforcement officers on the DPPA and the city's policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Liquidated Damages**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court declined to award liquidated damages, finding that Krekelberg was fairly compensated by the amount awarded by the jury and the court's decision to award attorneys' fees and costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Judgment Interest**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court granted Krekelberg's motion for post-judgment interest, ordering it to be calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 1961.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the court's opinion reflects a strong rebuke of the defendants' actions and a commitment to protecting individuals' privacy rights under the DPPA.\n",

      "This is a lengthy document detailing the investigation into an officer-involved shooting in Minnesota on August 5, 2018. The shooting resulted in the death of William Hughes. Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Two police officers, Adams and Jones, responded to a 911 call about two gunshots fired at a residence.\n",
      "* The caller did not identify himself, but it was later determined that he was E.L., who had been in the room with Mr. Hughes when he fired his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Incident Timeline**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Upon arrival, officers noticed a darkened house with only one light on outside and another small light coming from upstairs.\n",
      "* They knocked on door #1, and after hearing a verbal threat from Mr. Hughes (\"I will kill you\"), they took defensive positions and issued multiple loud verbal commands for him to come out with his hands up.\n",
      "* When Mr. Hughes stepped through door #2, he was holding a gun in his right hand and a cell phone in his left hand.\n",
      "* The officers ordered him to drop the gun, but he raised his right arm while still holding the gun, which they believed posed a deadly threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use of Deadly Force**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The officers' use of deadly force is justified under Minnesota Statutes 609.066, subdivision 2(1), as they reasonably believed Mr. Hughes posed a threat to their lives and those of others in the immediate area.\n",
      "* Additionally, the officers' use of deadly force is also justified under subdivisions 2(2) and (3), as they had reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Hughes had committed a felony involving the use of deadly force.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expert Opinion**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The document includes a letter from Richard J. Diisterhoft, a police expert with over 28 years of experience, who reviewed the statements and body-worn camera videos of the officers involved in the shooting.\n",
      "* Diisterhoft opines that the officers' tactics and use of deadly force were reasonable and consistent with generally accepted police practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The investigation concludes that the officers' use of deadly force was justified under Minnesota law, as they reasonably believed Mr. Hughes posed a threat to their lives and those of others in the immediate area.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here are some key points from the complaint:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Background**: Krekelberg was employed by the Minnesota State Patrol and had access to the Driver and Vehicle Services (DVS) database, which contains personal information about drivers in the state.\n",

She claims that this was done for purely personal reasons, such as to obtain her address or phone number.\n",
      "3.  **DPPA Violations**: The complaint alleges that these actions violated the DPPA, which prohibits law enforcement agencies and other entities from accessing personal information about drivers in the state's database without a permissible purpose.\n",
      "4.  **Counts of Liability**: Krekelberg brings several counts of liability against the various defendants, including Anoka County, Carver County, Hennepin County, Mille Lacs County, Ramsey County, Sherburne County, Wright County, City of Anoka, and City of Apple Valley.\n",

The footage shows officers Vince Adams and Matt Johnson responding to a call about a suicidal person and ultimately shooting Hughes after he pointed a gun at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points from the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The police department released the body-camera footage in response to public pressure and calls for transparency.\n",
      "*   The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) leading the probe.\n",
      "*   Ramsey County Attorney John Choi has stated that his office will analyze all evidence gathered by the BCA to determine whether the officers' use of lethal force was justified under the law.\n",
      "*   The police union has defended the actions of the officers involved, stating that they acted heroically and professionally in a difficult situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also notes that Hughes had been struggling with a terminal illness and had previously expressed suicidal thoughts. His family has spoken out about his kind heart and good character, and has called for greater understanding and support for individuals struggling with mental health issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the release of the body-camera footage is seen as an effort to promote transparency and accountability in law enforcement, while also highlighting the complexities and challenges involved in responding to situations involving suicidal individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court has ruled in favor of the defendants on several issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Statute of Limitations**: The court held that Krekelberg's Amended Complaint does not relate back to the date of her original complaint, and therefore, the statute of limitations bars claims against the Moving Defendants regarding lookups that occurred before June 16, 2011.\n",
      "2. **Equitable Estoppel**: The court found that equitable estoppel does not bar the Moving Defendants from relying on the statute of limitations, as there is no evidence that they engaged in dishonest or unlawful conduct that prevented Krekelberg from identifying them.\n",
      "3. **Qualified Immunity**: The court rejected the Moving Defendants' argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity, citing the Eighth Circuit's decision in McDonough v. Lee, 799 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2015), which held that viewing information in the motor-vehicle records database is equivalent to \"obtaining\" data in violation of the DPPA.\n",
      "4. **Triggering of the Statute of Limitations**: The court applied the \"occurrence rule,\" under which Krekelberg's causes of action accruedโand the statute of limitations began to runโwhen the allegedly impermissible lookups occurred, rejecting Krekelberg's argument that her discovery of Defendants' alleged DPPA violations should trigger the statute of limitations.\n",

      "This is a court decision in the case of Police Officers' Federation of Minneapolis v. City of Minneapolis, Civil No. 99-1048 (DWF/AJB). The court has ruled on several issues related to an affirmative action plan implemented by the City of Minneapolis for promoting diversity within its police force.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remedying Past Discrimination:** The court finds that the City's compelling government interest in remedying past employment discrimination is sufficient to support the expanded certification program.\n",
      "2. **Narrow Tailoring:** The court determines that the plan is narrowly tailored, as it has a limited duration (until the 13.3% threshold within the rank of sergeant is achieved) and does not require the promotion of unqualified minority candidates or suspension of promotions if there are no minority candidates to consider.\n",
      "3. **Relevant Labor Market:** The court finds that the relevant labor market for the police force is the local community, which includes both the City's population and surrounding areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ruling:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 18) and denies Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 13). The complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision upholds the constitutionality of the affirmative action plan implemented by the City of Minneapolis, which aims to promote diversity within its police force. The court's findings suggest that the plan is narrowly tailored and serves a compelling government interest in remedying past employment discrimination. However, the decision may have implications for other cities or organizations considering similar affirmative action plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision does not address the issue of promoting effective law enforcement through increasing diversity within the police force, which was mentioned as an additional compelling government interest by the Defendants. The court's focus on remedying past employment discrimination and narrow tailoring may limit the scope of future affirmative action plans in similar contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Future Research Directions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diversity and Effective Law Enforcement:** Further research could explore the relationship between diversity within police forces and effective law enforcement, including the impact on community trust and cooperation.\n",
      "2. **Narrow Tailoring and Affirmative Action Plans:** Scholars may investigate the implications of narrow tailoring for affirmative action plans in various contexts, including education, employment, and government contracting.\n",
      "3. **Remedying Past Discrimination:** Researchers could examine the effectiveness of affirmative action plans in remedying past discrimination, including their impact on promoting diversity and addressing systemic inequalities.\n",

      "This is a lengthy court decision, but I'll try to summarize the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Case Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involves a search warrant executed by Minneapolis police officers at the home of Darrell Williams. The plaintiffs (Darrell and Cymonne Williams) allege that the officers used excessive force during the execution of the warrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary Judgment Rulings**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cymonne Williams' Claims Dismissed**: The court grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims brought by Cymonne Williams.\n",
      "2. **Sergeants Voss, Anderson, and Officers Williams, Kading, Offbeck, Rud, and Angerhoffer Dismissed**: The court dismisses with prejudice all claims against these defendants pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n",
      "3. **Sergeant Sletta and Officer Kitzerow Dismissed**: The court dismisses with prejudice all claims against Sergeant Sletta and Officer Kitzerow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remaining Triable Issue**\n",
      "\n",
      "The sole triable issue remaining is whether Officer Mark Durand and/or the City of Minneapolis are liable for Officer Durand's kick to Plaintiff Darrell Williams' torso under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 or under Minnesota common law for assault or battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Excessive Force**: The court finds that kicking an unarmed non-suspect who is lying on the ground with his hands above his head is unreasonable.\n",
      "2. **Qualified Immunity**: Officer Durand is not entitled to qualified immunity because he caused more than de minimus injury (a rib contusion) to Darrell Williams.\n",
      "3. **Official Immunity**: Defendants are entitled to official immunity for their acts of striking Darrell Williams over the head and stepping on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court grants summary judgment in part and denies it in part, dismissing with prejudice all claims against certain defendants and leaving only one triable issue remaining: whether Officer Mark Durand and/or the City of Minneapolis are liable for Officer Durand's kick to Plaintiff Darrell Williams' torso.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Key Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Just Cause for Termination:** The City argues that it had just cause to terminate Officer Abdulkadir due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident, which is considered a serious offense.\n",
      "2.  **Burden of Proof:** The Federation counters that the City has the burden of proving just cause for termination and must meet a higher standard of proof (clear and convincing evidence) when the offense charged is one of a serious nature.\n",
      "3.  **Consistency in Rule Enforcement:** The Federation argues that the City's disciplinary pattern deviates from the general pattern applied in similar cases, which may indicate disparate treatment.\n",
      "4.  **Investigation:** The Federation criticizes the City for failing to conduct a thorough and fair investigation, including not interviewing key witnesses or gathering evidence related to the incident.\n",
      "5.  **Code of Conduct Policy:** The Federation argues that the City has not applied its code of conduct policy evenhandedly, as it typically considers factors such as prior disciplinary record, chemical dependency, and anger management issues before terminating an employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relevant Case Law:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Ulberg Termination Grievance:** The Federation cites a previous grievance case (Ulberg) where the arbitrator applied a higher standard of proof for termination due to a serious offense.\n",
      "2.  **Tillman, Anderson, Dinh, and Schnickel Cases:** The Federation references several cases where employees involved in domestic situations were not terminated for similar offenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigation Criticisms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Failure to Interview Key Witnesses:** The Federation criticizes the City for not interviewing key witnesses, including the alleged victim, her sister, or other police officers involved.\n",
      "2.  **Lack of Evidence Gathering:** The Federation argues that the City failed to gather evidence related to the incident, such as audio or transcribed police statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The document presents a detailed analysis of both sides' arguments in the grievance proceeding. The outcome will depend on the arbitrator's interpretation of the evidence and application of relevant case law.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Abdulkadir is entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive-force claim because a reasonable officer in his position would not have known that he was violating Mussa's rights.\n",
      "* Yang is also entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive-force claim because no reasonable jury could conclude that he knew that Abdulkadir would assault Mussa or that he had the opportunity to prevent the assault.\n",
      "* The court denied summary judgment on the First Amendment retaliation claim against Abdulkadir, finding that there are disputed facts about whether Abdulkadir's actions were motivated by a desire to retaliate against Mussa for exercising his First Amendment rights.\n",
      "* The court denied summary judgment on the Equal Protection claim against Abdulkadir, finding that there is evidence of discriminatory intent based on ethnic bias.\n",
      "* The court granted official immunity to Abdulkadir and the City on the assault and battery claims to the extent that they mirror the excessive-force claim, but denied it where Mussa alleges that the assault and battery were motivated by ethnic bias.\n",
      "\n",

      "This article appears to be a investigative report on the Minneapolis Police Department's handling of officer misconduct cases. The article highlights several instances where officers were accused of excessive force, harassment, or other forms of misconduct, but were either not disciplined or had their discipline reduced through arbitration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key points from the article include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The department's early warning system for identifying problem officers was found to be ineffective by a 2014 Department of Justice review.\n",
      "*   Arbitrators often reduce disciplinary decisions made by the police chief, allowing officers to return to duty with minimal punishment.\n",
      "*   The union frequently argues that officers are being treated unfairly and discriminated against, which can lead to reduced discipline or even reinstatement.\n",
      "*   The department's failure to consistently discipline officers for misconduct creates a \"bad precedent\" that can be used in future cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also highlights the personal stories of several individuals who were affected by police misconduct, including Luis Garcia, who was kicked in the face by Officer Blayne Lehner and suffered serious injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article from The 74 Million explores the history of discipline and civil rights complaints against Minneapolis Police Department officers who were stationed in schools. Here are some key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Officers' disciplinary records**: Internal police records obtained by The 74 likely offer an undercount of officer misconduct, with only 2.7% of complaints resulting in discipline between 2013 and 2019.\n",
      "2. **Good ol' boy network**: Former Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Adams described the department as having a \"good ol' boy network\" where officers protect their peers, allowing abuses to remain under the radar until they go to court.\n",
      "3. **Officers protecting colleagues**: The article highlights instances where officers intervened on behalf of colleagues accused of serious crimes, including one case where an officer defended a security guard who was accused of armed robbery.\n",
      "4. **Civil rights attorney's concerns**: Zorislav Leyderman, a civil rights attorney, stated that police misconduct incidents outside schools should influence whether those involved are assigned as school resource officers.\n",
      "5. **Lack of transparency**: The article notes that the Minneapolis Police Department has been sued and accused of illegally withholding misconduct records, including in cases of serious wrongdoing.\n",
      "6. **New direction for policing**: Ahead of next week's election, a recent poll suggests that voters will decide whether to dismantle the traditional police department or go in a completely new direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some quotes from the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"It's the good ol' boy network,\" Adams said. \"You've got guys who are in the police department that treat people wrong on purpose and you can see it.\"\n",
      "* \"They don't want to interact with law enforcement because they're worried that if they do, they're going to get injured,\" Leyderman said.\n",
      "* \"If you're a police officer and you're doing your job on the streets, there's a really good chance you're going to get sued somewhere in your career,\" Trump said.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Case Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involves a search warrant executed by Minneapolis police officers at the home of Darrell Williams. The plaintiffs (Darrell and Cymonne Williams) allege that the officers used excessive force during the execution of the warrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary Judgment Rulings**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cymonne Williams' Claims Dismissed**: The court grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims brought by Cymonne Williams.\n",
      "2. **Sergeants Voss, Anderson, and Officers Williams, Kading, Offbeck, Rud, and Angerhoffer Dismissed**: The court dismisses with prejudice all claims against these defendants pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n",
      "3. **Sergeant Sletta and Officer Kitzerow Dismissed**: The court dismisses with prejudice all claims against Sergeant Sletta and Officer Kitzerow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remaining Triable Issue**\n",
      "\n",
      "The sole triable issue remaining is whether Officer Mark Durand and/or the City of Minneapolis are liable for Officer Durand's kick to Plaintiff Darrell Williams' torso under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 or under Minnesota common law for assault or battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Excessive Force**: The court finds that kicking an unarmed non-suspect who is lying on the ground with his hands above his head is unreasonable.\n",
      "2. **Qualified Immunity**: Officer Durand is not entitled to qualified immunity because he caused more than de minimus injury (a rib contusion) to Darrell Williams.\n",
      "3. **Official Immunity**: Defendants are entitled to official immunity for their acts of striking Darrell Williams over the head and stepping on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court grants summary judgment in part and denies it in part, dismissing with prejudice all claims against certain defendants and leaving only one triable issue remaining: whether Officer Mark Durand and/or the City of Minneapolis are liable for Officer Durand's kick to Plaintiff Darrell Williams' torso.\n",

      "This is a lengthy opinion from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in a case involving a First Amendment challenge to the arrest and detention of several individuals who were participating in a street performance in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The court's opinion addresses four main issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Whether the plaintiffs' arrests and detentions violated their Fourth Amendment rights.\n",
      "2.  Whether the plaintiffs' seizures were motivated by retaliation for exercising their First Amendment right of free speech.\n",

      "This text appears to be a collection of news articles or investigative reports about various incidents involving the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) and its officers. Here's a summary of each incident:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long Crow**: The MPD raided the home of Kamyar Farahan, a Muslim man, in 2002, allegedly finding \"Mexican crack cocaine\" planted by an officer. None of the people present during the search were prosecuted for possession of drugs.\n",
      "2. **Farahan**: In 2001, Kamyar Farahan was pulled over and assaulted by police officers Robert Mooney and Patrick McCarver, who allegedly used ethnic slurs against him. The city settled with Farahan in 2003 for $90,000.\n",
      "3. **Buford**: Kevin Buford was beaten by off-duty officer Steven Tatro in a parking ramp in 1999. The MPD's Internal Affairs department found that Tatro had used excessive force. The city eventually settled with Buford for $125,000.\n",
      "4. **Greenberg**: Robert Greenberg was arrested and beaten by police officers during the May Day protest in 2000. The city settled out of court in 2003, paying him $75,000.\n",
      "5. **Long Crow (again)**: This incident is mentioned again as a separate case involving Kamyar Farahan's arrest and the alleged planting of evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some common themes emerge from these incidents:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Excessive use of force by MPD officers\n",
      "* Allegations of racial or ethnic bias against minority individuals\n",
      "* Planting of evidence to justify arrests\n",
      "* Lack of discipline for officers involved in misconduct\n",
      "* Settlements paid out by the city to victims of police misconduct\n",
      "\n",
      "The text also highlights some of the personnel involved in these incidents, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Officer Andrew Stender, who has a clean record despite being involved in at least one major payout.\n",
      "* Sgt. Robert Kroll, who was demoted for \"ethical violations\" and had previously been suspended for excessive use of force.\n",
      "* Lt. Scott Gerlicher, who was recently promoted to inspector and is the commander of the city's Third Precinct, despite having a record that includes squad accidents and allegations of excessive force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these incidents suggest a pattern of misconduct within the MPD, including excessive use of force, racial bias, and planting of evidence. The lack of discipline for officers involved in these incidents raises questions about accountability within the department.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here are some key points from the decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Summary Judgment**: The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, dismissing all claims brought by Embaye.\n",
      "2.  **Material Facts**: The court found that there were no material facts in dispute regarding the events of November 28, 2012, when Embaye was shot by police officers.\n",
      "3.  **Reasonableness of Police Actions**: The court determined that the actions of the police officers on the scene were reasonable under the circumstances and did not violate Embaye's constitutional rights.\n",
      "4.  **Norgaard Plea**: The court noted that Embaye had entered a Norgaard plea in state court, which is a type of guilty plea where the defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that there is sufficient evidence to convict them.\n",
      "5.  **Official Capacity Claims**: The court also dismissed Embaye's claims against the police officers in their official capacities, finding that these claims were merely suits against the public employer (the City of Minneapolis).\n",
      "6.  **No Genuine Dispute of Fact**: The court found that Embaye's assertions regarding his memory and actions on the night of November 28, 2012, were not credible and did not create a genuine dispute of fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the decision suggests that the court believed the police officers' actions were justified and that Embaye's claims lacked merit.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Reasonable Articulable Suspicion**: The court reviews determinations of reasonable articulable suspicion de novo and considers the totality of circumstances to determine whether a reasonable basis justified a stop.\n",
      "2.  **Credibility Determinations**: The district court's credibility determinations were not clearly erroneous, as they found that the police officers testified credibly at the omnibus hearing despite Ocer Bahl's sparse police report.\n",
      "3.  **Evasive Conduct**: The court held that the defendant's conduct was evasive, citing Illinois v. Wardlow (2000) and Florida v. Rodriguez (1984), which state that an attempt to evade an officer may be factored into an analysis of whether the officer had reasonable articulable suspicion to support a limited investigative stop.\n",

      "1. **Statute of Limitations**: The court held that Krekelberg's Amended Complaint does not relate back to the date of her original complaint, and therefore, the statute of limitations bars claims against the Moving Defendants regarding lookups that occurred before June 16, 2011.\n",
      "2. **Equitable Estoppel**: The court found that equitable estoppel does not bar the Moving Defendants from relying on the statute of limitations, as there is no evidence that they engaged in dishonest or unlawful conduct that prevented Krekelberg from identifying them.\n",
      "3. **Qualified Immunity**: The court rejected the Moving Defendants' argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity, citing the Eighth Circuit's decision in McDonough v. Lee, 799 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2015), which held that viewing information in the motor-vehicle records database is equivalent to \"obtaining\" data in violation of the DPPA.\n",
      "4. **Triggering of the Statute of Limitations**: The court applied the \"occurrence rule,\" under which Krekelberg's causes of action accruedโand the statute of limitations began to runโwhen the allegedly impermissible lookups occurred, rejecting Krekelberg's argument that her discovery of Defendants' alleged DPPA violations should trigger the statute of limitations.\n",

      "* The court holds that the police officers are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights of the plaintiff's son at the time of the arrest.\n",
      "* The court finds that there was no evidence to suggest that the police officers acted with malice or bad faith, which would have negated their entitlement to official immunity under Minnesota law.\n",
      "* The court affirms the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the police officers and the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from this opinion are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Qualified immunity is a doctrine that protects government officials from liability for their actions if they did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights at the time of the action.\n",
      "* To determine whether qualified immunity applies, courts must consider whether the plaintiff has cited any case law that clearly establishes the right being alleged to have been violated.\n",
      "* In this case, the court found that there was no such case law and therefore held that the police officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opinion also discusses Minnesota's official immunity doctrine, which provides that public officials are immune from liability for their actions if they acted in good faith and without malice. The court applied this doctrine to find that the police officers were entitled to official immunity under Minnesota law.\n",

      "**Case Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "The case involves a lawsuit filed by Amy Elizabeth Krekelberg against the City of Minneapolis and two police officers, Heather Young and Matthew Olson, alleging violations of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA). The DPPA prohibits law enforcement agencies from accessing personal information in driver records for non-law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trial**\n",
      "\n",
      "During trial, the court instructed the jury that any access by a Minneapolis law enforcement officer to DVS records for non-law enforcement purposes was a violation of the DPPA. The jury found in favor of Krekelberg and awarded her $1 million in damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Trial Motions**\n",
      "\n",
      "The defendants filed several post-trial motions, including motions for judgment as a matter of law, for a new trial, to alter/amend/correct judgment, and to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court granted some of these motions but denied others.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Attorneys' Fees**\n",
      "\n",
      "Krekelberg's attorneys requested $644,599.13 in attorneys' fees and $47,086.36 in costs. The court awarded these amounts, finding that they were reasonable and necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Equitable Relief**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court granted Krekelberg's motion for equitable relief, ordering the City of Minneapolis to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Revise its policies to prohibit access to DVS records for non-law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "2. Conduct a review of all personnel who accessed DVS records during the relevant time period.\n",
      "3. Provide training to all law enforcement officers on the DPPA and the city's policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Liquidated Damages**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court declined to award liquidated damages, finding that Krekelberg was fairly compensated by the amount awarded by the jury and the court's decision to award attorneys' fees and costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Judgment Interest**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court granted Krekelberg's motion for post-judgment interest, ordering it to be calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 1961.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the court's opinion reflects a strong rebuke of the defendants' actions and a commitment to protecting individuals' privacy rights under the DPPA.\n",

      "This is a lengthy document that appears to be a legal brief in support of a motion for summary judgment in a civil rights case. The plaintiff, Guled, alleges that the defendants, police officers Tucker, Bartholomew, Conner, and Garbisch, used excessive force against him during an arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brief argues that the defendants' use of deadly force was justified under the circumstances, citing various Supreme Court cases, including Sykes v. United States (2011) and Graham v. Connor (1989). The brief also cites Eighth Circuit case law, such as Heartland Academy Community Church v. Waddle (2010), to support its argument that each defendant's conduct must be independently assessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brief addresses the four elements of a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim: 1) an objective reasonableness standard; 2) the severity of the intrusion; 3) the need for the use of force; and 4) whether the force used was proportionate to the threat posed. The brief argues that each element is met in this case, as the defendants had probable cause to believe Guled posed a threat of serious harm, and their use of deadly force was necessary to prevent injury to themselves and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brief also addresses the issue of individual officer liability, arguing that each defendant's conduct must be independently assessed. The brief argues that Tucker and Bartholomew had probable cause to believe Guled posed a threat of serious danger when they pursued him in their squad car. Conner believed that Garbisch was in grave danger and that the situation merited the use of deadly force. Garbisch, who was pinned partially inside his squad, drew his gun and fired at the Nissan as it approached him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brief concludes by arguing that the defendants' use of deadly force was objectively reasonable under the circumstances, and that they are entitled to summary judgment on Guled's excessive force claim.\n",

One male was removed from his squad car due to a warrant, and there was a verbal exchange between Officer Barze and the suspect.\n",
      "2.  **Officer O'Hanlon's account**: Officer O'Hanlon stated that he responded to assist Officer Barze with a call received on the school radio. He reported that Officer Barze made contact with the group, and two Transit PD Officers arrived in a squad car. One male was removed from Officer Barze's squad car due to a warrant.\n",
      "3.  **Use of force**: Officer O'Hanlon claimed that the suspect offered minor resistance during the arrest, but he did not remember anyone telling the suspect they were under arrest. He stated that he tried to stay away from body weight take-downs as he had broken his leg doing them in the past.\n",
      "4.  **Injury to the suspect**: Officer O'Hanlon reported that the suspect was injured during the arrest, with an abrasion on their cheek. Officer Barze used a Sani-wipe to clean the wound and applied a Band-Aid.\n",
      "5.  **Officer O'Hanlon's knowledge of policy**: When questioned about MPD policy regarding reporting use-of-force incidents, Officer O'Hanlon stated that he was aware that a supervisor should be called and a CAPRS report was required in such cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation appears to be focused on determining the circumstances surrounding the injury to the suspect and whether any policies or procedures were violated during the arrest.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Summary of Allegations**\n",
      "\n",
      "The allegations against Officer Barze and the other two officers involved in the arrest are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Excessive force was used during the arrest, resulting in injuries to the juvenile male being arrested.\n",
      "2. A supervisor was not notified of the arrest or the use of force.\n",
      "3. The CAPRS report (Computer-Aided Police Reporting System) was incomplete and did not fully document the arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigation Findings**\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation found that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Officer Barze, an on-duty School Resource Officer, participated in the arrest along with two other officers.\n",
      "* The juvenile male being arrested suffered a laceration over his left orbital bone during the arrest.\n",
      "* Officer Barze provided first aid to the juvenile male but did not notify a supervisor of the injury or complete a use-of-force report.\n",
      "* A JDC (Juvenile Detention Center) video confirmed the injury, and a JDC staff nurse recommended medical treatment at HCMC (Hennepin County Medical Center).\n",
      "* Officer Barze stated he did not inform JDC about the injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disciplinary Action**\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the investigation, Officer Barze was suspended for 20 hours without pay. The suspension was based on a \"B\" level violation of MPD Policy 5-306, which requires officers to report use of force incidents and notify supervisors.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **The initial encounter**: The corporal explains that he was on directed patrol to monitor individuals hanging around specific areas, particularly 8th Street and Hennepin. He noticed the complainant trying to keep himself behind an utility box, which drew his attention.\n",
      "2.  **Reason for stop**: The corporal states that he tried to inform the complainant of the reason for the stop but was interrupted by the complainant's yelling before he could say anything.\n",
      "3.  **Use of force**: The corporal acknowledges using physical force to subdue the complainant, stating that he had to fight him to the ground and kicked his arm out from under him.\n",
      "4.  **Decision to arrest**: The corporal explains that he decided to take the complainant to jail instead of issuing a citation due to the complainant's uncooperativeness and lack of a permanent address.\n",
      "5.  **Investigation into allegations**: The corporal denies seeing Officer HB kick the complainant in the shoulder, but acknowledges kicking his arm out from under him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key points that emerge from this conversation include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The corporal's primary concern was to determine why the complainant was hanging around the area and whether he had any legitimate reason for being there.\n",
      "*   The corporal felt that the complainant was uncooperative and tried to keep himself hidden behind an utility box, which raised his suspicions.\n",
      "*   The corporal acknowledges using physical force to subdue the complainant but claims it was necessary due to the complainant's resistance.\n",
      "*   The decision to arrest the complainant instead of issuing a citation was based on his lack of a permanent address and uncooperativeness.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury's verdict, as the jury had the responsibility to determine which witnesses seemed credible and could reasonably infer from the circumstances that the defendant intended to assault the police officer.\n",
      "2. The defendant cannot escape liability for assaulting an off-duty police officer because the officer still had a duty to respond to emergency situations and protect pedestrians, even if he was not on duty at the time of the incident.\n",
      "3. The verdict is not legally inconsistent because the requisite states of mind for first-degree assault (intent) and reckless driving (recklessness) are compatible, as recklessness refers to the risk created by an individual's actions, rather than their mental intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court's decision is based on a thorough analysis of the evidence presented at trial and the relevant statutes and case law. The court's conclusion that the verdict is not legally inconsistent is supported by the fact that the defendant was charged with both first-degree assault (which requires intent) and reckless driving (which requires recklessness), but the two offenses are not mutually exclusive.\n",

      "This is a long and complex article about a police raid in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that went horribly wrong. Here's a summary of the main points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Raid**\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 7, 1996, the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) conducted a raid on a house at 2216 26th Avenue North in Minneapolis. The ERU is a high-risk unit that conducts raids on suspected drug dealers and other violent offenders. The team was led by Deputy Chief Bill Jones and included officers from the ERU and the public housing unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Shooting**\n",
      "\n",
      "During the raid, something went terribly wrong. A gunfight broke out between the police and Andre Madison, who was inside the house with his family. Madison claimed that he had been asleep when the police burst in and that he didn't have a gun until one of the officers pointed it at him. The police claim that Madison fired first, but there is no evidence to support this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Aftermath**\n",
      "\n",
      "Madison was charged with four counts of second-degree assault with a firearm, which carry a presumptive sentence of 12 years in prison. However, if he pleads guilty to one misdemeanor charge of reckless use of a firearm, the other charges will be dropped and he'll only face 90 days in jail.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Investigation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Deputy Chief Bill Jones asked Champlin Police Chief Allen Garber to investigate the incident and provide recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future. Garber's report concluded that the ERU and public housing officers acted in good faith, but that there were several problems with the raid, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Lack of clear assignments and instructions for the public housing officers\n",
      "* No standard operating procedure for perimeter officers\n",
      "* Inadequate training for non-ERU personnel working on raids with the unit\n",
      "* Over-reliance on dynamic (door-ramming) raids\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Legacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Madison raid has had a lasting impact on the ERU and the Minneapolis Police Department. The incident highlighted the need for better training, coordination, and equipment for high-risk units like the ERU. In response to Garber's report, the MPD increased the budget and coordination of the unit's training programs and agreed to reduce the ERU's workload by allowing other teams to conduct lower-risk warrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some members of the ERU remain dissatisfied with the changes and claim that they are still understaffed and under-equipped. The incident has also sparked a civil lawsuit against the city and the police department, alleging that the cops' actions violated Madison's civil rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Human Cost**\n",
      "\n",
      "The article concludes by highlighting the human cost of the raid. Both the police officers involved in the raid and Andre Madison were traumatized by the experience. Garber notes that it's easy to analyze what happened after the fact, but much harder to understand the fear and uncertainty that the officers faced during the raid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the article provides a detailed and nuanced account of a complex incident that raises important questions about police training, equipment, and accountability.\n",

The Employer (City of Plymouth Police Department) argues that the Grievant's conduct was unbecoming and damaged the department's reputation.\n",

The Arbitrator also finds that the Grievant's conduct could damage the department's public image.\n",

      "Here are some key points made in the brief:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Court of Appeals erred in finding a ministerial duty**. The brief argues that the imposition of a ministerial duty on police officers during emergency situations will chill their exercise of independent judgment and discretion.\n",
      "2.  **The decision undermines the doctrine of official immunity**. The brief argues that the court's focus on municipal policy rather than the conduct of the public officials involved undermines the purposes of official immunity, which is to protect public officials from liability for discretionary acts performed in good faith.\n",
      "3.  **The officers did not engage in a willful or malicious wrong**. The brief argues that the plaintiff must present specific facts showing that the officer knew that their actions lacked legal justification, and that the plaintiff failed to meet this burden.\n",

      "The court held that there was no constitutional violation by the individual officers, as they were justified in using deadly force to protect themselves from Alfred's apparent attempt to run them over. The court also rejected Sanders' argument that the City's failure to train its officers on how to approach individuals with mental illnesses was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n",

      "2. **Minnesota Statute ยง 347.22**: The court held that Minnesota Statute ยง 347.22, which establishes strict liability for dog bites, applies to police dogs and municipalities that own them, citing the recent decision in Hyatt v. Anoka Police Dept., 691 N.W.2d 824 (Minn. Feb. 10, 2005).\n",
      "3. **Quali7ed Immunity**: The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the issue of quali7ed immunity, finding that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether the officer acted reasonably in using the canine to apprehend the suspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opinion suggests that the plaintiff's version of events, which alleges that the officer sicced the dog on him without provocation and while he was attempting to comply with the officer's directives, could support a 7nding that the officer used excessive force.

      "* Police departments may need to re-evaluate their policies on the use of canines in apprehending suspects.\n",

      "3. **Punitive Damages**: The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on this claim, finding that a jury could conclude that the police officers acted with reckless or callous indifference to the decedent's constitutional rights.\n",

      "This is a lengthy court order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil rights case. Here's a brief summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Case Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiff, representing the estate of a man named Sanders who was shot and killed by police officers, brought a lawsuit against various defendants, including the City of Minneapolis, its police officers, and Augsburg College Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Claims**\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated Sanders' constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment (excessive force) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The plaintiff also claimed that the City of Minneapolis had a policy or custom of failing to train its officers in how to handle mentally ill individuals, which led to the use of excessive force.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Court's Ruling**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims. The court found that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. There was no evidence that the police officers used excessive force against Sanders.\n",
      "2. The ADA claim failed because it can only be brought against public entities, and the individual defendants were not public entities.\n",
      "3. The Monell claims (failure to train or improperly train officers) failed because there was no evidence of a constitutional violation and no evidence that any policy or custom of Minneapolis resulted in constitutional violations.\n",
      "4. The court also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff's attorney, Richard Olivito, for failing to withdraw an expert witness who had been deemed unqualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sanctions**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court ordered Olivito to pay $4500 in sanctions, which would be apportioned as follows: $2000 to Steven Manhood, $2000 to Josef Garcia and Augsburg College, and $500 to the City of Minneapolis and its Defendant police officers. The court also notified the Supreme Court of Ohio's Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline about Olivito's conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this case highlights the importance of carefully evaluating evidence and claims in civil rights cases, as well as the consequences of failing to comply with court orders and rules of professional conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a court decision in the case of Police Officers' Federation of Minneapolis v. City of Minneapolis, Civil No. 99-1048 (DWF/AJB). The court has ruled on several issues related to an affirmative action plan implemented by the City of Minneapolis for promoting diversity within its police force.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remedying Past Discrimination:** The court finds that the City's compelling government interest in remedying past employment discrimination is sufficient to support the expanded certification program.\n",
      "2. **Narrow Tailoring:** The court determines that the plan is narrowly tailored, as it has a limited duration (until the 13.3% threshold within the rank of sergeant is achieved) and does not require the promotion of unqualified minority candidates or suspension of promotions if there are no minority candidates to consider.\n",
      "3. **Relevant Labor Market:** The court finds that the relevant labor market for the police force is the local community, which includes both the City's population and surrounding areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ruling:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 18) and denies Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 13). The complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision upholds the constitutionality of the affirmative action plan implemented by the City of Minneapolis, which aims to promote diversity within its police force. The court's findings suggest that the plan is narrowly tailored and serves a compelling government interest in remedying past employment discrimination. However, the decision may have implications for other cities or organizations considering similar affirmative action plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision does not address the issue of promoting effective law enforcement through increasing diversity within the police force, which was mentioned as an additional compelling government interest by the Defendants. The court's focus on remedying past employment discrimination and narrow tailoring may limit the scope of future affirmative action plans in similar contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Future Research Directions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diversity and Effective Law Enforcement:** Further research could explore the relationship between diversity within police forces and effective law enforcement, including the impact on community trust and cooperation.\n",
      "2. **Narrow Tailoring and Affirmative Action Plans:** Scholars may investigate the implications of narrow tailoring for affirmative action plans in various contexts, including education, employment, and government contracting.\n",
      "3. **Remedying Past Discrimination:** Researchers could examine the effectiveness of affirmative action plans in remedying past discrimination, including their impact on promoting diversity and addressing systemic inequalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision provides valuable insights into the constitutionality of affirmative action plans and their implementation in various contexts.\n",

      "2. **Long Crow**: A case where several MPD officers were accused of planting evidence during a raid on a residence in the Phillips neighborhood. The city settled the case for $60,000.\n",
      "3. **Kamyar Farahan**: An Iranian-American man who was pulled over by two MPD officers and allegedly subjected to ethnic harassment and excessive force. The city paid him $90,000 to settle his lawsuit.\n",
      "4. **Kevin Buford**: A man who was beaten by an off-duty MPD officer in a parking ramp. The city paid him $125,000 to settle his lawsuit.\n",
      "5. **Robert Greenberg**: A protester who was allegedly beaten by several MPD officers during the May Day protest in 2000. The city paid him $75,000 to settle his lawsuit.\n",

      "* Ethnic harassment and profiling by MPD officers\n",
      "* Lack of accountability and discipline for MPD officers involved in these incidents\n",

      "This text appears to be a collection of news articles or investigative reports about various incidents involving the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) and its officers. Here's a summary of each incident:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long Crow**: The MPD raided the home of Kamyar Farahan, a Muslim man, in 2002, allegedly finding \"Mexican crack cocaine\" planted by an officer. None of the people present during the search were prosecuted for possession of drugs.\n",
      "2. **Farahan**: In 2001, Kamyar Farahan was pulled over and assaulted by police officers Robert Mooney and Patrick McCarver, who allegedly used ethnic slurs against him. The city settled with Farahan in 2003 for $90,000.\n",
      "3. **Buford**: Kevin Buford was beaten by off-duty officer Steven Tatro in a parking ramp in 1999. The MPD's Internal Affairs department found that Tatro had used excessive force. The city eventually settled with Buford for $125,000.\n",
      "4. **Greenberg**: Robert Greenberg was arrested and beaten by police officers during the May Day protest in 2000. The city settled out of court in 2003, paying him $75,000.\n",
      "5. **Long Crow (again)**: This incident is mentioned again as a separate case involving Kamyar Farahan's arrest and the alleged planting of evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some common themes emerge from these incidents:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Excessive use of force by MPD officers\n",
      "* Allegations of racial or ethnic bias against minority individuals\n",
      "* Planting of evidence to justify arrests\n",
      "* Lack of discipline for officers involved in misconduct\n",
      "* Settlements paid out by the city to victims of police misconduct\n",
      "\n",
      "The text also highlights some of the personnel involved in these incidents, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Officer Andrew Stender, who has a clean record despite being involved in at least one major payout.\n",
      "* Sgt. Robert Kroll, who was demoted for \"ethical violations\" and had previously been suspended for excessive use of force.\n",
      "* Lt. Scott Gerlicher, who was recently promoted to inspector and is the commander of the city's Third Precinct, despite having a record that includes squad accidents and allegations of excessive force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these incidents suggest a pattern of misconduct within the MPD, including excessive use of force, racial bias, and planting of evidence. The lack of discipline for officers involved in these incidents raises questions about accountability within the department.\n",

      "\n",
      "The plaintiff, Boone, alleged that he was subjected to retaliation and discriminatory treatment by his employer, the St. Paul Police Department (SPPD), after he complained about racist comments made by a superior officer. The court considered several claims, including retaliation, aiding and abetting reprisal, and disparate treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court found that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Boone failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation for several reasons:\n",
      "\t* He did not show that his complaints about the racist comments were protected activities.\n",
      "\t* He did not demonstrate a causal link between his complaints and the alleged retaliatory actions taken by the SPPD.\n",
      "\t* The SPPD articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for their actions, which Boone failed to rebut as pretextual.\n",
      "2. Boone's claim of aiding and abetting reprisal also failed because he did not establish that any retaliatory acts occurred.\n",
      "3. The court rejected Boone's argument that the SPPD's refusal to return him to the gang unit was unlawful retaliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n",

      "This is a lengthy opinion from a Minnesota appeals court case, State v. Schmidtbauer (2001). The case involves a defendant who was charged with manufacturing methamphetamine and gave a confession to police during an interrogation. The defendant's attorney argued that the confession was involuntary because it was induced by promises of leniency made by the interrogators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority opinion held that the confession was voluntary, but the concurring special opinion written by Judge R.A. Randall disagreed. Judge Randall found that the interrogators' promises of leniency were coercive and induced the defendant's confession. However, he also noted that the prosecutor had later agreed to recommend a reduced sentence for the defendant, which mitigated the coercive effect of the interrogators' promises.\n",
      "\n",

However, the judge finds that the search was lawful because it was based on probable cause and was conducted with a valid warrant. The judge also notes that even if the search were unlawful, the defendant's motion to suppress would still fail because he has not shown that the evidence was obtained in bad faith.\n",

      "\n",
      "The defendant argues that the government's dismissal of the original indictment without prejudice and subsequent re- indictment violates his right to a speedy trial under the Speedy Trial Act.

      "* The totality of the circumstances supported the officers' reasonable suspicions that the defendant was armed.\n",
      "* The motion to suppress should therefore be denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the Motion to Dismiss Indictment, the Magistrate Judge found that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The interstate commerce element is satisfied by proving that the firearm was manufactured in one state and recovered in another.\n",
      "* A firearm possessed by a convicted felon only needs to have traveled at some time in interstate commerce โ it does not need to travel with the defendant in interstate commerce.\n",
      "* The fact that the firearm was manufactured in Massachusetts and seized in Minnesota satisfies the interstate nexus requirement.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The article discusses how positional asphyxia, also known as compression asphyxia, is a recognized cause of death when an individual is restrained in a position that restricts their ability to breathe.\n",
      "* Dr. Reay, a forensic pathologist, had been warning about the dangers of prone restraint for over 20 years.\n",

      "\n",
      "* The article details how George Floyd was killed by Officer Derek Chauvin during his arrest on May 25, 2020.\n",
      "* Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for approximately nine minutes, causing compression asphyxia and ultimately leading to Floyd's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Training and Policies**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The article highlights that the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) had a policy allowing officers to use their legs to apply pressure to a person's neck during restraint.\n",
      "* This policy was unique compared to other police departments in the country, which often emphasize rolling individuals onto their side to prevent positional asphyxia.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expert Testimony**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Dr. Reay testified that compression asphyxia is a recognized cause of death and that it can occur even without any underlying medical conditions.\n",
      "* He also stated that the use of prone restraint increases the risk of positional asphyxia, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart disease or respiratory issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigation and Trial**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The article mentions that the investigation into Floyd's death was led by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and involved multiple agencies.\n",
      "* Chauvin is currently on trial for his role in Floyd's death, and the article notes that expert testimony from Dr. Reay and other medical professionals has been presented to the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reforms and Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The article highlights that some police departments have implemented reforms to reduce the risk of positional asphyxia during restraint.\n",
      "* It also mentions that the Minneapolis Police Department has since revised its policies on prone restraint, emphasizing the importance of rolling individuals onto their side to prevent compression asphyxia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this article provides a detailed examination of the risks associated with police restraint and its connection to George Floyd's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "This appears to be a report on an investigation into allegations of misconduct by Sergeant Robert Berry, a Minneapolis Police Department officer. The report summarizes the events surrounding a domestic assault incident involving Berry and his ex-wife, 13.43.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "* On May 20, 2017, Hastings Police Officers responded to a 911 hang-up call at the residence of Sergeant Robert Berry and 13.43.\n",
      "* 13.43 told officers that she had been assaulted by her ex-husband, Robert Berry, during an argument at their residence.\n",
      "* Physical signs of injury were observed on 13.43's body as a result of the domestic assault.\n",
      "* Sergeant Robert Berry was charged with gross misdemeanor interfering with a 911 call and misdemeanor domestic assault.\n",
      "* In a recorded interview with Internal Affairs, Berry acknowledged that his actions likely caused injury to 13.43.\n",
      "* On August 21, 2017, Sergeant Berry was convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault and placed on probation for one year.\n",
      "* The case is \"continued for dismissal\" if Berry successfully completes the probation period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report concludes by asking whether Sergeant Robert Berry assaulted his ex-wife, thus violating the ethical standards of the Minneapolis Police Department. Based on the evidence presented, it appears that Berry did indeed commit a domestic assault and was held accountable for his actions through the criminal justice system.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the report also highlights some inconsistencies in 13.43's statements to investigators, which may have implications for her credibility as a witness. However, this does not appear to be a major focus of the investigation or the report.\n",

      "This is a court opinion from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, case number 09-3733. The opinion discusses a lawsuit filed by the mother of a man who died during an arrest by police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issues in this case are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Qualified immunity: The court must determine whether the police officers were entitled to qualified immunity from liability for their actions.\n",
      "2. Excessive force: The plaintiff alleged that the police officers used excessive force against her son, which led to his death.\n",
      "3. Wrongful death claim: The plaintiff also brought a wrongful death claim under Minnesota law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court's decision is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The court holds that the police officers are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights of the plaintiff's son at the time of the arrest.\n",
      "* The court finds that there was no evidence to suggest that the police officers acted with malice or bad faith, which would have negated their entitlement to official immunity under Minnesota law.\n",
      "* The court affirms the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the police officers and the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from this opinion are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Qualified immunity is a doctrine that protects government officials from liability for their actions if they did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights at the time of the action.\n",
      "* To determine whether qualified immunity applies, courts must consider whether the plaintiff has cited any case law that clearly establishes the right being alleged to have been violated.\n",
      "* In this case, the court found that there was no such case law and therefore held that the police officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opinion also discusses Minnesota's official immunity doctrine, which provides that public officials are immune from liability for their actions if they acted in good faith and without malice. The court applied this doctrine to find that the police officers were entitled to official immunity under Minnesota law.\n",
      "\n",
      "This court opinion discusses the case of State v. Smith, where the defendant was stopped by police for speeding and evading arrest. The defendant argued that his seizure was unconstitutional and that the evidence obtained as a result should be suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court held that the seizure was lawful because it was based on reasonable suspicion, and that the use of force by the officer was justified under the circumstances. The court also rejected the defendant's argument that he was under arrest rather than being detained for an investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the court declined to consider a new issue raised by the defendant on appeal regarding the search of a black plastic bag containing marijuana, as it was not properly before the court and had not been raised in the district court. The opinion affirms the conviction and sentence of the defendant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from this case are:\n",
      "\n",

The arbitrator, Sherwood Malamud, was appointed to hear the case under the Minnesota Veterans Preference Act (Minn. Stat. Sec. 197.46). Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Officer Brazeau is a veteran and was employed by the City of Minneapolis Police Department.\n",
      "* He was terminated on February 15, 2019, for allegedly using excessive force against a suspect, BD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Findings of Fact**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The arbitrator reviewed extensive evidence, including videos, reports, and testimony from Deputy Chief Halverson, Chief of Police Arradondo, and Officer Brazeau.\n",
      "* The central issue was whether the amount of force used by Officer Brazeau on December 29, 2016, was excessive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusions of Law**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The arbitrator concluded that the City had not met its burden of proof to show that Officer Brazeau's use of force was excessive and violated the Department's Use of Force Policy (5-303).\n",
      "* The arbitrator noted that the objective reasonableness standard, as established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Graham v. Connor (1989), requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each situation.\n",
      "* The arbitrator found that Officer Brazeau had a range of discretion in using force, including strikes, under the Department's Use of Force Matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Award**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The arbitrator concluded that the City did not have just cause to discharge Officer Brazeau.\n",
      "* Instead, the arbitrator ordered an 80-hour suspension without pay for Officer Brazeau.\n",
      "* Additionally, the arbitrator required the City to provide Officer Brazeau with training on safely handcuffing individuals and addressing continued resistance by a handcuffed individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Discussion**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The arbitrator noted that police officers often face challenging situations where they must use force to protect themselves or others.\n",
      "* The arbitrator emphasized the importance of proper training and discretion in using force, as well as the need for careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this arbitration award highlights the complexities of police use-of-force cases and the importance of balancing officer safety with the need to minimize harm to suspects.\n",

      "This is a lengthy court opinion, but I'll try to summarize the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiff, Kennedy-Bey, filed a complaint against the Metropolitan Council and its employees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging that his arrest was unlawful and seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Analysis of Claims**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Monetary Damages**: The court concludes that Kennedy-Bey's claims for monetary damages are barred because the Metropolitan Council is a political subdivision of the State of Minnesota, and as such, it is not a \"person\" subject to suit under ยง 1983.\n",
      "2. **Punitive Damages**: The court also finds that punitive damages are unavailable against government officials in their official capacities.\n",
      "3. **Injunctive Relief**: Kennedy-Bey lacks standing to seek injunctive relief because he does not allege any real or immediate threat of future harm from the defendants.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Qualified Immunity**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court conducts an analysis of qualified immunity, which shields government officials from liability unless their conduct \"violated a clearly established constitutional or statutory right of which a reasonable official would have known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prong 1: Violation of Constitutional Right**: The court concludes that Kennedy-Bey's arrest was supported by probable cause, and therefore, there is no violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n",
      "2. **Prong 2: Clearly Established Right**: Even if the court had found a violation of Kennedy-Bey's constitutional rights, it would not have been clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court recommends that all aspects of Kennedy-Bey's ยง 1983 claim be dismissed with prejudice because he cannot seek monetary or punitive damages from any of the defendants, and he lacks standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief on the violation on which he bases his federal claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific points!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a lengthy opinion from the Minnesota Court of Appeals in a post-conviction relief case. The court addresses several issues raised by the petitioner, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Destruction of evidence**: The petitioner claimed that the police destroyed or failed to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence, specifically J.L.'s clothing and used condoms found at her residence. The court held that the destruction of this evidence did not constitute a due-process violation because it was not shown that the police acted in bad faith.\n",
      "2. **Brady claim**: The petitioner also claimed that the state suppressed evidence favorable to his defense, which would have been admissible under Brady v. Maryland (1963). However, the court found that the presence of used condoms at J.L.'s residence was not relevant or admissible evidence in this case.\n",
      "3. **Investigative duty**: The petitioner argued that Officer Brolsma failed to investigate properly and learn about favorable evidence. However, the court held that there is no legal authority imposing a duty on police to learn of favorable evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court ultimately affirmed the post-conviction relief court's denial of the petitioner's claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key takeaways from this opinion include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* To establish a due-process violation for destruction or failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence, a petitioner must show that the police acted in bad faith.\n",
      "* The presence of used condoms at J.L.'s residence was not relevant or admissible evidence in this case.\n",
      "* There is no legal authority imposing a duty on police to learn of favorable evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings are based on the specific facts and circumstances of this case, but they may have broader implications for post-conviction relief cases involving allegations of destroyed or suppressed evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing 270/2302...\n",
      "This is a lengthy opinion from the Minnesota Supreme Court regarding a lawsuit filed under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 by the husband of a woman who was killed during a police chase. The court's opinion addresses several issues, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of his wife's Fourth Amendment rights.\n",
      "2. Whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.\n",
      "3. Whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of his own Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court concludes that the plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of his wife's Fourth Amendment rights, but that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim because they did not use excessive force in pursuing the woman who was killed. The court also concludes that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim because their actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court further concludes that the plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of his own Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights, and that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on this claim. The court holds that the use of deadly force against the woman who was killed was not justified by any legitimate law enforcement purpose, and that the officers' actions were motivated by an intent to injure her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court's opinion is lengthy and complex, but it can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of his wife's Fourth Amendment rights.\n",
      "* The defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim because they did not use excessive force in pursuing the woman who was killed.\n",
      "* The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim because their actions were reasonable under the circumstances.\n",
      "* The plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of his own Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights.\n",
      "* The defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court's opinion is significant because it addresses several important issues in the law of excessive force and qualified immunity. It also highlights the importance of careful analysis and consideration of the facts and circumstances of each case when determining whether a police officer's use of force was justified or whether they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n",

      "This appears to be a lengthy and detailed report from an internal investigation into allegations made against a police officer, Christopher Bennett. The report outlines the steps taken by the investigator to gather evidence and interview witnesses, including Officer Bennett himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key findings of the report are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Officer Bennett's credibility is questioned**: During his statement, Officer Bennett claimed not to remember making the call to the Complainant or using his department-issued cell phone on that date. He also provided inconsistent explanations for the calls made from his wife's cell phone.\n",
      "2.  **The investigation found evidence contradicting Officer Bennett's claims**: The Subscriber Activity Detail records showed that Officer Bennett did make a call to the Complainant's phone, and he was unable to provide a plausible explanation for this.\n",
      "3.  **Officer Bennett's alibi is not supported by evidence**: He claimed to have been on a call with his partner at the time of the alleged incident, but the investigation found that they were actually 3.7 miles away from the Complainant's address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these findings, the investigator concludes that Officer Bennett's explanation for the events in question is not credible and that he likely made the call to the Complainant using his department-issued cell phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report recommends that the allegations against Officer Bennett be sustained under Chapter 172, which requires a preponderance of evidence (i.e., more than half) to support the decision.\n",

The POST Board is responsible for licensing and disciplining police officers in the state, but it has been criticized for its lenient approach to discipline and its failure to hold officers accountable for misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key findings from the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Most officers convicted of serious crimes go undisciplined**: Only 24% of police officers who were convicted of serious crimes in Minnesota were disciplined by the POST Board, while 76% went without any disciplinary action.\n",
      "2. **Weak regulatory authority and strong police unions**: The article suggests that Minnesota's weak regulatory authority and strong police unions contribute to the lack of accountability in the state's law enforcement community.\n",
      "3. **Lack of transparency and oversight**: The POST Board's meetings are closed to the public, and its decisions are not published except for a mention in the regular minutes of the board. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to hold the board accountable for its actions.\n",
      "4. **No central tracking system for misconduct**: Minnesota lacks a rigorous system for reporting misconduct, on duty or off duty, to the state. The POST Board relies heavily on word of mouth and news reports to learn of officer misconduct.\n",
      "5. **High rate of driving-related offenses**: About 60% of the convictions since 1995 involve serious driving-related offenses such as drunken driving, criminal vehicular operations, and reckless driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also highlights several specific cases of police officers who were convicted of serious crimes but went without any disciplinary action from the POST Board. These cases include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Michael Lorsung**: A former police chief in Frazee, Minnesota, who was charged with felony theft and embezzlement after prosecutors said he hid a patrol vehicle behind a six-foot privacy fence at his home.\n",
      "2. **Terry Bayne**: A Pennington County deputy who lost his license after being convicted of stealing money from a desk in the office years ago. The governor pardoned him, and the POST Board issued him a new license.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Claims:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **False Arrest**: Cornelious alleges that he was arrested without probable cause.\n",
      "2. **Excessive Force**: Cornelious claims that he was subjected to excessive force by police officers during his arrest.\n",
      "3. **Conspiracy**: Cornelious asserts that there was a conspiracy among the defendants to deprive him of his constitutional rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **False Arrest**: The court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether Cornelious' arrest was motivated by malice, and therefore denies summary judgment on this claim.\n",
      "2. **Excessive Force**: The court concludes that there are sufficient facts to support a finding of excessive force against Ocer Brubaker, and denies his motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.\n",
      "3. **Conspiracy**: To establish a conspiracy under ยง 1983, Cornelious must show that the defendants reached an understanding to deprive him of his constitutional rights. The court finds that Cornelious has presented sufficient evidence to support this claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Denial of Summary Judgment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court denies summary judgment on all claims against Ocer Brubaker and Anaya, Gardner (Capital Defendants). The Capital Defendants' motion for summary judgment is also denied due to questions of fact regarding the necessity defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Respondeat Superior Claim:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The court finds that Cornelious has presented sufficient evidence to support a respondeat superior claim against Capital Investigations, which will survive summary judgment if the individual defendants' claims are successful.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   The union frequently argues that officers are being treated unfairly and discriminated against, which can lead to reduced discipline or even reinstatement.\n",
      "*   The department's failure to consistently discipline officers for misconduct creates a \"bad precedent\" that can be used in future cases.\n",

      "2. **Section 1981 and MHRA Discrimination Claims**: The court determines that there is no evidence of racial animus or intentional discrimination by the officers.\n",

      "4. **Tort Claims**:\n",
      "\t* **Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress**: The court determines that Seivers' alleged emotional distress symptoms are not severe enough to meet the physical manifestation requirement.\n",
      "\t* **Invasion of Privacy**: The court finds that the alleged intrusion occurred in public, not in seclusion, and Minnesota courts have never recognized a cause of action for invasion of privacy in the context of police conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Claims Remaining:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Section 1983 Claim**: This claim is still pending, but the court's order does not address it specifically.\n",
      "2. **Statutes of Limitations and Improper Service of Process**: The court notes that these issues are not addressed in its order because it grants defendants' motion in full.\n",

      "**Allegation #2:**\n",

      "\n",
      "Here are some key points from the document:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Background**: On April 11, 2020, Andrew Sundberg was involved in a standoff with MPD officers at his apartment building.\n",
      "2. **Initial Response**: Officers responded to the scene, and after several hours of negotiations, they attempted to break out the windows using less-lethal rounds.\n",
      "3. **Shooting**: After breaking out the windows, Sundberg continued to refuse to surrender, and officers eventually fired shots, hitting him in the shoulder and chest. He was pronounced dead at 4:39 am.\n",
      "4. **Investigations**: The Minnesota Department of Human Rights (MDHR) and the United States Department of Justice opened pattern and practice investigations into the MPD following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Officers in 2020.\n",
      "5. **Findings**: Both reports found that the MPD engages in a pattern or practice of discriminatory, race-based policing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some specific findings from the MDHR investigation include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Black individuals make up approximately 19% of Minneapolis's population but accounted for 63% of all use-of-force incidents recorded by MPD officers.\n",
      "* The City and MPD engage in a pattern or practice of race discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also includes details about the events leading up to Sundberg's shooting, including his interactions with police and the negotiations that took place before the shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a lengthy opinion from the Minnesota Supreme Court addressing the constitutionality of a statute that makes it a crime for a person acting in a fiduciary capacity to intentionally fail to use the financial resources of a vulnerable adult to provide food, clothing, shelter, health care, therapeutic conduct, or supervision for the vulnerable adult. The court concludes that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague and addresses several arguments made by the respondent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from the opinion are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Vagueness**: The court holds that the statute provides sufficient notice to a person in a fiduciary relationship with a vulnerable adult, such as the respondent, that they cannot spend the financial resources of the vulnerable adult on items unrelated to care or welfare without appropriate permission.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Arbitrary and Discriminatory Enforcement**: The court finds that the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is speculative and insufficient to render the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Ambiguity**: The court concludes that the language of the statute is not sufficiently ambiguous to invoke the rule of lenity, which would require a narrow construction of the statute.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Mens Rea Requirement**: The court holds that the statute requires an actor to intentionally fail to use the financial resources of a vulnerable adult for their care and basic needs, thus requiring a mens rea element (criminal intent or recklessness) for conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Minnesota Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of the statute, finding it provides sufficient notice and does not create a strict-liability crime.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Incident:** On June 4, 2015, Officer James Boyd was scheduled to testify in court but failed to appear. He later showed up at the city attorney's office, where he made comments about not caring if the judge held him in contempt or issued a warrant for his arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigation:** The investigation found that Officer Boyd had been instructed to come to court on June 3, 2015, but never showed up as the court waited for around two hours. The judge then decided to dismiss the jury and reconvene the next morning. City Attorney Flavio Abreu stated that he made a judgment call not to call Officer Boyd again because he was uncooperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disciplinary Action:** A settlement agreement was reached between the city, the police officers' federation, and Officer Boyd. The agreement states that Officer Boyd will receive a 5-hour unpaid suspension for violating the department's code of ethics (Policy Number 5-102). The grievance was withdrawn with prejudice, meaning it cannot be reopened.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Officer Boyd failed to appear in court on June 3, 2015.\n",
      "* He made comments about not caring if the judge held him in contempt or issued a warrant for his arrest.\n",
      "* City Attorney Flavio Abreu stated that he made a judgment call not to call Officer Boyd again because he was uncooperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** The investigation and disciplinary action against Officer James Boyd demonstrate that he failed to follow departmental policies and procedures, leading to a loss of trust in the court system. The settlement agreement reflects the city's efforts to resolve the matter amicably while also holding Officer Boyd accountable for his actions.\n",

      "4. **Sgt. Shawn Kelly and Officer Jason Schmitt**: Both officers were part of the SWAT team that fatally shot Dolal Idd in 2020. The city's critical incident review has not concluded.\n",
      "5. **Officer Matthew Hobbs**: Hobbs was reassigned to a new unit after being involved in a lawsuit related to excessive force.\n",

      "\n",

      "This appears to be a transcript of an interview with Officer Troy Carlson regarding an incident involving a suspect named AP2 Lilienfeld. The interview is part of an investigation into allegations of excessive force and misconduct by the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points from the transcript:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Officer's account of the incident**: Officer Carlson describes how he arrived at the scene, observed AP2 Lilienfeld on the ground, and attempted to handcuff him. He claims that AP2 resisted arrest and was eventually subdued with a closed-hand strike to his mid-section.\n",
      "2. **Contradiction in reports**: The officer's initial report (CAPRS supplement) does not mention a strike to the shoulder area, which he had previously described in an earlier statement. When questioned about this discrepancy, Officer Carlson attributes it to a \"mistake\" and suggests that the incident was captured on video.\n",
      "3. **Handling of AP2 after arrest**: The officer describes how he brought AP2 back to his squad car, patted him down, and searched his belongings before placing him in the rear of the vehicle. He claims not to have had any conversation with AP2 about injuries during this time.\n",
      "4. **Lack of knowledge about AP2's injuries**: Officer Carlson states that he was unaware of any alleged injuries sustained by AP2 until the complaint arose later.\n",
      "5. **Questioning about potential chokehold**: The interviewer asks if there was any conflict or incident involving a possible chokehold, but Officer Carlson denies any such occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transcript raises questions about the officer's credibility and the accuracy of his reports. The investigation will likely continue to examine these issues further.\n",

      "This is a lengthy document detailing an investigation into a police shooting incident involving two officers, Malmberg and Robins, who fatally shot Raul Heraldes after he stabbed another man, Alan Coleman, in the back with a large knife. The document provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the shooting, including the dispatch call, the arrival of the officers, and the subsequent negotiations with Heraldes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation concludes that the use of deadly force by Officers Malmberg and Robins was justified under Minnesota law (Minn. Stat. ยง 609.066) and the constitutional standard established in Graham v. Connor (1989). The report states that the officers' use of force was objectively reasonable in the face of the danger of death or great bodily harm to Coleman, themselves, and other officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the officers' use of force include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Severity of the crime at issue**: Heraldes was stabbing Alan Coleman in the back with his knife, which is a serious felony crime.\n",
      "2.  **Whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others**: Heraldes posed a clear and immediate threat to Alan Coleman during the stabbing and also threatened Officers Perkins and Graupner earlier.\n",
      "3.  **Whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight**: Heraldes refused to surrender himself, release Coleman, or open the locked apartment door at the police's command.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation concludes that the officers' use of deadly force was justified because they had probable cause to believe that Heraldes posed a threat of serious bodily harm to themselves and others. The report also notes that the officers attempted to placate and negotiate with Heraldes by calling his wife and repeatedly offering help, but he remained locked in the apartment with Coleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this analysis, it appears that the investigation concluded that Officers Malmberg and Robins acted reasonably in using deadly force against Raul Heraldes.\n",

      "This is a lengthy arbitration decision that resolves a grievance filed by an employee, Steve Cater, against his employer, the Jail Commander (the person of highest authority at the detention center). The grievance concerned the level of discipline imposed on Cater for violating the Employer's sick leave policy. Here are the key points from the decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background**: Cater was placed on medical leave due to an injury and was restricted from working during certain times, including weekends. However, he worked on a Saturday and Sunday without permission, which led to his suspension.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arbitrator's Decision**: The arbitrator found that the twenty-hour suspension imposed on Cater was not for just cause because it included an indefinite suspension from the Marine Unit, which entailed loss of specialty pay, training, and other opportunities connected with the Marine Unit. The Employer failed to justify this aspect of the discipline.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning**: The arbitrator considered various factors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Employer's progressive discipline policy.\n",
      "2. Cater's honesty about his actions and his explanation for why he acted as he did.\n",
      "3. The fact that Cater suffered no financial penalty due to the twenty-hour suspension (since he was paid 30 hours of pay for working on June 15 and 16).\n",
      "4. The lack of evidence that Cater deliberately flouted Employer policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Order**: The arbitrator ordered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Disciplinary Notice issued to Steve Cater dated July 17, 2019 be amended by striking any reference to suspending Cater from the Marine Unit.\n",
      "2. The Employer immediately reinstate Steve Cater to the Marine Unit and make him whole for any wages, pay or remuneration lost as a result of his suspension from the Marine Unit on July 17, 2019.\n",
      "3. Provide training to Cater so that he is qualified as a member of the Marine Unit with the same standing he had prior to July 17, 2019.\n",
      "4. Expunge the July 17, 2019 Disciplinary Notice from Cater's personnel file and from any other files maintained by the Employer on July 17, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**: The arbitrator found that while a twenty-hour suspension was an appropriate level of discipline in light of all the circumstances, the indefinite suspension from the Marine Unit was not justified.\n",

      "* The use of deadly force by the officers was deemed necessary to protect themselves and others from apparent death or great bodily harm.\n",
      "* The investigation considered several factors, including:\n",
      "\t+ Severity of the crime: Firing a gun in a residential neighborhood posed an imminent threat to person safety.\n",
      "\t+ Immediate threat: Blevins' possession of a loaded handgun and decision to take it out of his pocket as he turned towards the officers posed an immediate threat to their safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Forensic Evidence**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Forensic analysis found that the cartridge case from the area where the 911 caller saw Blevins fire his gun was determined to have been fired from the gun recovered near Blevins' body.\n",
      "* DNA analysis confirmed that Blevins' fingerprints and DNA were on the gun, magazine, cartridges, and cartridge cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Legal Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Hennepin County Attorney's Office reviewed the investigation and concluded that the use of deadly force by the officers was permitted under Minnesota law (Minn. Stat. ยง 609.066, subd. 2).\n",
      "* The report notes that the United States Supreme Court has outlined several non-exclusive factors to consider when evaluating whether the use of deadly force is reasonable, including:\n",
      "\t+ Severity of the crime at issue\n",
      "\t+ Whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others\n",
      "\t+ Whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight\n",

      "This article from The 74 Million explores the history of discipline and civil rights complaints against Minneapolis Police Department officers who were stationed in schools. Here are some key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Officers' disciplinary records**: Internal police records obtained by The 74 likely offer an undercount of officer misconduct, with only 2.7% of complaints resulting in discipline between 2013 and 2019.\n",
      "2. **Good ol' boy network**: Former Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin's public record excluded a 2014 incident where he hit a 14-year-old boy with a flashlight and pinned him to the ground for 17 minutes, highlighting a pattern of officers protecting their peers.\n",
      "3. **Civil rights attorney Zorislav Leyderman** represented plaintiffs in six lawsuits against Minneapolis police officers stationed in schools, stating that officer misconduct incidents outside schools should influence whether those involved are assigned as school resource officers.\n",
      "4. **Parent advocate Khulia Pringle** believes that officers' disciplinary records should be a major factor when placing them inside schools and that police have no place walking hallways.\n",
      "5. **Research on policing in schools**: Studies suggest that while officers reduce some forms of violent crimes, their presence prompts an uptick in suspensions and arrests, especially for Black students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some notable quotes from the article include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"It's the good ol' boy network,\" said Adams, a former Minneapolis police officer who defended a security guard accused of a serious crime. \"You've got guys who are in the police department that treat people wrong on purpose and you can see it.\"\n",
      "* \"If you're a police officer and you're doing your job on the streets, there's a really good chance you're going to get sued somewhere in your career,\" said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services. \"But there should be some sort of baseline criteria and screening set by your police administration before that pool of officers is ever presented at that next step to your school people.\"\n",

      "Overall, the article highlights the complexities of policing in schools and raises questions about whether officers with disciplinary records or a history of misconduct should be assigned to work with students.\n",

      "This is a lengthy document detailing an investigation and disciplinary action against Minneapolis Police Officer James Boyd. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background**: On December 3, 2013, Officer Boyd was working with another officer in Squad 431 when they received a call about a \"Sound of Shots Fired\" at 39th Ave N/Lyndale Ave N. The squad remained stationary for 7 minutes and 50 seconds at the Holiday Gas Station before responding to the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigation**: An internal affairs investigation found that Officer Boyd did not respond without delay to the call, violating Policy Number 5-106 (1), which states that officers shall respond without delay to calls for police service unless otherwise directed by proper authority. The investigation also found that the squad spent a total of 30 minutes and 47 seconds stationary during the response.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disciplinary Action**: Officer Boyd was disciplined with a Category B violation, which carries a penalty of 20 hours unpaid suspension. This decision was made after a settlement agreement between the City of Minneapolis and the Police Officers' Federation of Minneapolis (the union representing Officer Boyd).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Settlement Agreement**: The settlement agreement states that the union withdraws its grievance against the disciplinary action, and in exchange, the city agrees to impose a 20-hour suspension. The agreement also includes provisions that prevent the use of this case as precedent or evidence in future proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the investigation found that Officer Boyd did not respond promptly to an emergency call, violating departmental policy. As a result, he was disciplined with a suspension, and the city and union reached a settlement agreement to resolve the matter.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Police Code of Silence**: The article highlights the \"Code\" that exists among police officers, where they often cover up for each other's wrongdoing.\n",
      "2. **Civilian Review Board**: The MPD has a Civilian Review Board (CRA) to investigate complaints against police officers. However, the board is often ineffective, and its findings are frequently disputed by the police department.\n",
      "3. **Settlements and Litigation**: The city of Minneapolis pays out millions in settlements for police misconduct cases, which can be costly and may not always result in disciplinary action against the offending officers.\n",
      "4. **Low Police Numbers**: The MPD has been understaffed in recent years, leading to increased stress on remaining officers and potentially contributing to a culture of aggression and misconduct.\n",
      "5. **Specific Cases**:\n",
      "\t* A white police officer, Phillip Hogquist, was accused of assaulting a 75-year-old black woman, Gayna Wiggins, and her mother, Rayma. The jury awarded $355,775.83 in damages.\n",
      "\t* Another case involved a police officer who was reprimanded multiple times for misconduct, including firing his gun while intoxicated and using vulgar language towards citizens.\n",
      "6. **Police Culture**: The article suggests that the MPD has a culture of aggression and entitlement among some officers, which can lead to misconduct and abuse of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the article raises concerns about police accountability, transparency, and the need for reform within the MPD.\n",

      "\n",
      "The case involves a lawsuit filed by Amy Elizabeth Krekelberg against the City of Minneapolis and two police officers, Heather Young and Matthew Olson, alleging violations of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA). The DPPA prohibits law enforcement agencies from accessing personal information in driver records for non-law enforcement purposes.\n",

      "**Trial**\n",
      "\n",
      "During trial, the court instructed the jury that any access by a Minneapolis law enforcement officer to DVS records for non-law enforcement purposes was a violation of the DPPA. The jury found in favor of Krekelberg and awarded her $1 million in damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Trial Motions**\n",
      "\n",
      "The defendants filed several post-trial motions, including motions for judgment as a matter of law, for a new trial, to alter/amend/correct judgment, and to stay the judgment pending appeal. The court granted some of these motions but denied others.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Attorneys' Fees**\n",
      "\n",
      "Krekelberg's attorneys requested $644,599.13 in attorneys' fees and $47,086.36 in costs. The court awarded these amounts, finding that they were reasonable and necessary.\n",

      "**Equitable Relief**\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Revise its policies to prohibit access to DVS records for non-law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "2. Conduct a review of all personnel who accessed DVS records during the relevant time period.\n",
      "3. Provide training to all law enforcement officers on the DPPA and the city's policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Liquidated Damages**\n",

      "The court declined to award liquidated damages, finding that Krekelberg was fairly compensated by the amount awarded by the jury and the court's decision to award attorneys' fees and costs.\n",

      "3. **Assault and battery**: The court denied summary judgment on these claims as well, finding that there were factual issues regarding whether the defendants' actions were justified.\n",
      "4. **False arrest**: The court denied summary judgment on this claim, which is a state-law claim for false arrest.\n",
      "5. **False imprisonment**: The court also denied summary judgment on this claim, which is another state-law claim.\n",

The case revolves around eight Facebook posts made by Mr. Crofton in 2017 that were deemed racially derogatory and Islamophobic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Termination**: MPD terminated Mr. Crofton's employment due to his Facebook posts, which they considered a violation of the department's Code of Ethics.\n",
      "2. **VPA**: The VPA protects veterans from removal from public employment \"except for incompetency or misconduct shown after a hearing.\"\n",
      "3. **Burden of Proof**: The employer (MPD) has the burden of establishing by substantial evidence that it acted reasonably when discharging Mr. Crofton.\n",
      "4. **Reasonableness**: The arbitrator must consider whether MPD's action was reasonable, including the effect on the workplace and work environment, as well as Mr. Crofton's competency and fitness for the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The case hinges on whether Mr. Crofton's Facebook posts were intended to be innocuous or racially derogatory. The arbitrator must determine whether MPD acted reasonably in terminating Mr. Crofton's employment based on his actions.\n",

      "However, an unexpected twist occurred during the hearing when Mr. Crofton testified about his desire to return to active duty as a police officer and asked for a chance to \"redeem himself.\" This testimony raises questions about Mr. Crofton's motivations and whether he is genuinely seeking redemption or attempting to salvage his career.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The arbitrator must carefully consider the evidence presented, including the intent behind Mr. Crofton's Facebook posts and the impact of his actions on the workplace and community. The arbitrator will need to weigh the burden of proof on MPD against any extenuating circumstances that may justify a modification in the disciplinary sanction.\n",

Lee, 799 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2015), which held that viewing information in the motor-vehicle records database is equivalent to \"obtaining\" data in violation of the DPPA.\n",
      "4. **Triggering of the Statute of Limitations**: The court applied the \"occurrence rule,\" under which Krekelberg's causes of action accruedโand the statute of limitations began to runโwhen the allegedly impermissible lookups occurred, rejecting Krekelberg's argument that her discovery of Defendants' alleged DPPA violations should trigger the statute of limitations.\n",

      "2.  **Immediate threat**: Mr. Jordan came at the officers with a large knife, posing an immediate threat to their safety.\n",
      "3.  **Active resistance or flight**: Mr. Jordan refused to cooperate and repeatedly approached the officers while waving the knife.\n",

Lee, 799 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2015), which held that viewing information in the motor-vehicle records database is equivalent to \"obtaining\" data in violation of the DPPA.\n",
      "4. **Triggering of the Statute of Limitations**: The court applied the \"occurrence rule,\" under which Krekelberg's causes of action accruedโand the statute of limitations began to runโwhen the allegedly impermissible lookups occurred, rejecting Krekelberg's argument that her discovery of Defendants' alleged DPPA violations should trigger the statute of limitations.\n",
